## Agent Skills (Capabilities)
FLUO uses Agent Skills for progressive disclosure of technical capabilities:
- `.skills/architecture/` - Pure application framework patterns, ADR compliance
- `.skills/security/` - OWASP review, compliance controls, cryptography
- `.skills/quality/` - Test coverage analysis, edge case detection
- `.skills/implementation/` - PRD execution, API/UI patterns
- `.skills/product/` - PRD creation from vague requirements
- `.skills/compliance/` - SOC2/HIPAA evidence generation
- `.skills/fluo-dsl/` - Write and validate FLUO DSL rules for trace patterns
- `.skills/nix/` - Flake patterns, build optimization
- `.skills/java-quarkus/` - Quarkus backend patterns
- `.skills/react-tanstack/` - React frontend patterns

**How Skills Work:**
- Each skill is a directory with `SKILL.md` (YAML metadata + instructions)
- Load skills dynamically based on task relevance
- Progressive disclosure: metadata ‚Üí summary ‚Üí detailed docs
- Answer: "How do we do this?" (technical execution)

## Subagents (Perspectives)
FLUO uses perspective-based subagents that mirror enterprise team roles:
- `.subagents/product-manager/` - Customer value, market fit, prioritization
- `.subagents/engineering-manager/` - Team velocity, technical debt, capacity
- `.subagents/tech-lead/` - System design, scalability, architecture
- `.subagents/security-officer/` - Risk management, compliance, threats
- `.subagents/sre/` - Reliability, observability, production readiness
- `.subagents/business-analyst/` - ROI, stakeholder alignment, requirements
- `.subagents/customer-success/` - User experience, adoption, support

**How Subagents Work:**
- Each subagent has `PERSPECTIVE.md` (role + decision framework)
- Provide stakeholder viewpoints on decisions
- Answer: "Should we do this? Why? For whom?" (strategic planning)
- Use skills for technical execution after perspective informs direction

**Skills vs. Subagents:**
- **Skills** = Technical capabilities (OWASP checklist, PRD template, test patterns)
- **Subagents** = Stakeholder perspectives (customer value, team capacity, security risk)
- **Workflow**: Subagent (perspective) ‚Üí Skill (capability) ‚Üí Implementation

## ‚ö° FLUO's Core Purpose

**FLUO is a Behavioral Assurance System for OpenTelemetry Data**

Enables pattern matching on telemetry for:
1. **SREs**: Discover undocumented invariants that cause incidents
2. **Developers**: Define invariants to expose service misuse
3. **Compliance**: Match trace patterns to evidence control effectiveness
4. **AI Safety**: Monitor AI system behavior in production (agents, hallucinations, bias)

**Core Workflow:**
```
OpenTelemetry Traces ‚Üí Rules (Invariants) ‚Üí Signals (Violations) ‚Üí Investigation
```

**Market Validation:**
> "Hardware-enabled mechanisms could help customers and regulators to monitor general-purpose AI systems more effectively during deployment...but reliable mechanisms of this kind **do not yet exist**."
>
> ‚Äî International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI (96 experts, 30+ countries, January 2025)

**FLUO fills this gap** through behavioral assurance: continuous production monitoring where testing fails.

**What FLUO is NOT:**
- ‚ùå Not a SIEM/SOAR/security incident response platform
- ‚ùå Not an IOC-based threat detection system
- ‚ùå Not a generic observability/APM tool
- ‚ùå Not pre-deployment testing (we monitor production behavior)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start development environment
nix run .#dev

# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend:  http://localhost:8080
# Grafana:  http://localhost:12015
```

## Project Structure

**Pure Application Framework** (deployment-agnostic):
- `bff/` - React + Tanstack + Vite frontend
- `backend/` - Quarkus (Java 21) API
- `flake.nix` - Local development orchestration only

## Core Principles

1. **Pure Applications** - Export packages, not infrastructure
2. **Local Development First** - Instant startup, hot reload
3. **Deployment Agnostic** - External consumers handle deployment

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development
nix run .#dev           # Both apps with hot reload
nix run .#frontend      # Frontend only
nix run .#backend       # Backend only

# Build & Test
nix build .#all         # Build applications
nix run .#test          # Run tests once with coverage
nix run .#test-watch    # Continuous testing (file watcher)
nix run .#test-tui      # Interactive TUI with live results
nix run .#test-coverage # Serve HTML coverage reports on :12099
nix run .#validate-coverage  # Check 90% instruction, 80% branch thresholds
nix run .#serve         # Production preview

# Observability
nix run .#restart       # Restart observability services
```

## Shell Prompt Integration

FLUO includes a custom ZSH prompt that displays test stats directly in your command line:

**Example Prompt:**
```
~/Projects/fluo  main ‚úÖ 94/94 89%
‚ûú
```

**What it shows:**
- Current directory (blue)
- Git branch (green if clean, yellow* if uncommitted changes)
- Test results: `‚úÖ passed/total coverage%` or `‚ùå failed/total`
- Stats appear when test results are < 30 minutes old

**Setup:**

The prompt is automatically configured via `.envrc` (direnv):
```bash
cd /path/to/fluo      # direnv automatically sets up prompt
```

Or manually:
```bash
nix develop           # Sets up on first run in shellHook
nix run .#setup-prompt  # Manual setup/reconfiguration
```

The prompt configuration is automatically activated when you:
1. Enter the project directory (via direnv `.envrc`)
2. Run `nix develop` (via shellHook)
3. Source `~/.zshrc` (persistent across all shells)

## Test Runner Features

The test-runner provides a fully-featured development experience:

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Runs BFF (Vitest) and Backend (JUnit) tests in parallel
- ‚úÖ File watching with auto-execution on changes
- ‚úÖ Real-time coverage tracking (90% instruction, 80% branch thresholds)

- ‚úÖ Test result history tracking (last 50 runs)
- ‚úÖ Coverage trend analysis
- ‚úÖ Desktop notifications with icons and sounds (‚úÖ/‚ùå/‚ö†Ô∏è)
- ‚úÖ Process-compose orchestration

**Usage Patterns:**

```bash
# Quick test run with summary
nix run .#test

## Enterprise AI Safety

**As validated by the International AI Safety Report**, FLUO addresses three critical gaps in AI risk management:

### 1. AI Agent Monitoring (Q1 2025 Priority)
**Report Finding**: "Testing is insufficient for agents because they can distinguish test from production"

**FLUO Solution**: Runtime behavioral monitoring
```javascript
// Goal deviation detection
trace.has(agent.plan.created) and trace.has(agent.plan.executed)
trace.goal_deviation(original_goal, current_actions) < threshold

// Prompt injection / hijacking detection
trace.has(agent.instruction_source) and source not in [authorized_list]

// Tool use authorization
trace.has(agent.tool_use) and tool requires human_approval
```

**Use Cases**: Legal research agents, customer service agents, code generation agents

### 2. Hallucination Detection
**Report Finding**: "AI generates false statements...particularly concerning in high-risk domains"

**FLUO Solution**: Pattern-based reliability verification
```javascript
// Medical diagnosis requires citations
trace.has(medical.diagnosis) and not trace.has(source_citation)

// Low-confidence claims require disclosure
trace.has(factual_claim) and confidence < 0.7
  and not trace.has(uncertainty_disclosure)
```

**Use Cases**: Healthcare clinical decision support, legal advice systems, financial recommendations

### 3. Bias Detection
**Report Finding**: "New evidence...has revealed more subtle forms of bias"

**FLUO Solution**: Statistical distribution analysis
```javascript
// Hiring bias detection
trace.has(hiring.decision)
  and distribution_by(candidate.race) != expected_distribution

// Lending bias detection
trace.has(loan.approval_decision)
  and approval_rate_by(applicant.gender) has statistical_anomaly
```

**Use Cases**: Hiring AI, lending decisions, healthcare treatment recommendations

**For detailed implementation**: See @marketing/docs/AI-SAFETY-FOR-ENTERPRISE.md

## Compliance by Design

FLUO generates compliance evidence through trace patterns:

**Security Principles:**
1. **Never log PII without @Redact** - Use RedactionStrategy.HASH for sensitive data
2. **Compliance spans must be signed** - Cryptographic integrity for audit evidence
3. **Rules are sandboxed** - DSL cannot access service layer or mutate state
4. **Tenant crypto isolation** - Per-tenant encryption keys via KMS

**Implementation:**
- `@SOC2(controls = {CC6_1})` emits compliance spans automatically
- DSL rules validate patterns: `trace.has(pii.access) and trace.has(audit.log)`
- Evidence queryable via compliance API for auditors

See @docs/compliance-status.md and @docs/compliance.md for details.

## External Deployment

Deployment is a **consumer responsibility**. Consumers create external flake projects:

```nix
# external-deploy/flake.nix
inputs.fluo.url = "github:org/fluo";
outputs = { fluo, ... }: {
  packages.deployment = deployWith {
    frontend = fluo.packages.x86_64-linux.frontend;
    backend = fluo.packages.x86_64-linux.backend;
  };
};
```
