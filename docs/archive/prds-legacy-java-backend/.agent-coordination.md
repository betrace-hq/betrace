# Agent Coordination - BeTrace Production Readiness Analysis

## Objective
Identify all gaps needed to make BeTrace production-ready and create ordered PRDs for implementation.

## Agent Assignments

### security-expert
**Primary Responsibility:** Production security gaps
**Analysis Document:** `.agent-analysis-security.md`
**Final Say On:** Security PRDs, compliance PRDs, authentication/authorization PRDs

### product-analyst
**Primary Responsibility:** Feature completeness by persona
**Analysis Document:** `.agent-analysis-product.md`
**Final Say On:** Feature PRDs, user workflow PRDs, UX PRDs

### qa-expert
**Primary Responsibility:** Testing and quality infrastructure
**Analysis Document:** `.agent-analysis-qa.md`
**Input On:** Test coverage PRDs, quality gate PRDs

### architecture-guardian
**Primary Responsibility:** System architecture completeness
**Analysis Document:** `.agent-analysis-architecture.md`
**Input On:** Architecture PRDs, integration PRDs, scalability PRDs

## Collaboration Process

1. **All agents analyze independently** using their analysis documents
2. **Report findings** with priorities and dependencies
3. **security-expert and product-analyst consolidate** into ordered PRD list
4. **Resolve conflicts:**
   - Security requirements override feature preferences
   - Product analyst validates security solutions meet user needs
   - Architecture guardian ensures solutions are feasible
   - QA expert ensures solutions are testable

## PRD Creation Guidelines

Each PRD must include:
- **Title:** Clear, action-oriented
- **Priority:** P0/P1/P2
- **Complexity:** Simple/Medium/Complex
- **Personas:** Who benefits (SRE/Developer/Compliance/All)
- **Problem:** What's broken or missing
- **Solution:** What to build
- **Success Criteria:** How to verify completion
- **Dependencies:** Which other PRDs must complete first
- **Security Impact:** Any security considerations
- **Testing Requirements:** How to test this

## PRD Ordering Strategy

Order PRDs so each can be completed sequentially:

1. **Foundation first** - Security, auth, persistence
2. **Core features** - Rule engine, signal generation
3. **User workflows** - UI for each persona
4. **Polish** - Analytics, reporting, optimizations

Within each tier, order by:
1. Dependencies (prerequisites first)
2. Risk (P0 before P1)
3. Complexity (simple before complex when no dependencies)

## Deliverable

Numbered PRDs in docs/prds/:
- `001-prd-title.md`
- `002-prd-title.md`
- etc.

The number determines implementation order.
