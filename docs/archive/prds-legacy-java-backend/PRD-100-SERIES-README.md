## Key Principles

### 1. Honest Transparency
- Never claim certifications BeTrace doesn't have
- Link to `compliance-status.md` for honest status
- Position transparency as competitive advantage

### 2. Multi-Persona Optimization
- Different CTAs for SRE, Director, Compliance personas
- Buying committee optimization (not individual touchpoints)
- Multiple conversion paths (self-service vs sales-led)

### 3. Fast, Focused, Actionable
- Page load <2s (every second = 7% conversion loss)
- Clear value prop in <5 seconds
- Specific CTAs ("Try Demo" not "Learn More")

### 4. Evidence-Based
- All benchmarks sourced (Unbounce, Gartner, Navattic)
- A/B test all major decisions
- Monthly analytics review, iterate

### 5. Content-Led Growth
- Own "behavioral assurance" category
- Technical depth (not marketing fluff)
- SEO-first (rank for long-tail keywords)

---

## Dependencies & Cross-References

### External Dependencies
- BeTrace frontend (PRD-102 demo environment)
- BeTrace backend (API reference docs)
- Early customers (PRD-106 case studies)

### Internal Cross-Links
- PRD-100 embeds PRD-101 (demo)
- PRD-100 links to PRD-102 (docs)
- PRD-103 references PRD-104 (ROI)
- PRD-105 cross-links PRD-100-104
- PRD-108 orchestrates all CTAs
- PRD-109 promotes all content

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: No customers for case studies (PRD-106)
**Mitigation:** Start with anonymized case studies, mock data until real customers

### Risk: Low organic traffic (slow SEO growth)
**Mitigation:** Focus on distribution (LinkedIn, HackerNews), paid ads initially

### Risk: Conversion rate below 2% (baseline)
**Mitigation:** A/B test everything, iterate monthly based on analytics

### Risk: High CAC (>$500/customer)
**Mitigation:** Double down on content marketing (lower CAC than paid ads)

### Risk: Positioning confusion (BeTrace vs APM)
**Mitigation:** PRD-105 comparison pages, "BeTrace is NOT" sections everywhere
