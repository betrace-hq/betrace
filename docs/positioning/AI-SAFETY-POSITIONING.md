# BeTrace: Filling the Gaps Identified by 96 AI Safety Experts

**One-Page Positioning Document for Sales & Marketing**

---

## The Market Validation

> "Hardware-enabled mechanisms could help customers and regulators to monitor general-purpose AI systems more effectively during deployment and potentially help verify agreements across borders, but **reliable mechanisms of this kind do not yet exist**."
>
> — International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI
> 96 experts from 30+ countries, Chair: Yoshua Bengio, January 2025

**BeTrace is that mechanism.**

## Three Critical Gaps Identified by the Report

| Gap | Report Finding | BeTrace Solution |
|-----|---------------|---------------|
| **1. Pre-deployment testing fails** | "Spot checks miss hazards because test conditions differ from real world" | Production trace monitoring catches what testing misses |
| **2. AI internals inscrutable** | "Developers cannot explain why models create outputs" | Observe behavior externally, don't require understanding internals |
| **3. No quantitative risk metrics** | "Lack quantitative risk estimation unlike aerospace/nuclear" | Pattern match rates, violation counts, behavioral drift scores |

---

## BeTrace's Category: "Behavioral Assurance for AI Systems"

**Not pre-deployment testing** (we monitor production)
**Not interpretability** (we observe behavior, not internals)
**Not traditional monitoring** (we detect patterns, not just metrics)

**Is**: Continuous behavioral verification in production using OpenTelemetry traces

---

## Three Enterprise Use Cases (With Code)

### 1. AI Agent Monitoring (Q1 2025 Priority)
**Report Quote**: "Testing is insufficient for agents because they can distinguish test from production"

**Pattern**:
```javascript
// Goal deviation detection
trace.goal_deviation(original_goal, current_actions) < threshold

// Prompt injection / hijacking detection
trace.has(agent.instruction_source) and source not in [authorized_list]
```

**Value**: Runtime monitoring where testing fails (legal research agents, customer service agents)

---

### 2. Hallucination Detection
**Report Quote**: "AI generates false statements...particularly concerning in high-risk domains"

**Pattern**:
```javascript
// Medical diagnosis requires citations
trace.has(medical.diagnosis) and not trace.has(source_citation)

// Low-confidence claims require disclosure
trace.has(factual_claim) and confidence < 0.7
```

**Value**: Liability prevention in healthcare, legal, financial advice

---

### 3. Bias Detection
**Report Quote**: "New evidence...has revealed more subtle forms of bias"

**Pattern**:
```javascript
// Statistical distribution analysis
trace.has(hiring.decision)
  and distribution_by(candidate.race) != expected_distribution
```

**Value**: GDPR Article 22 compliance, fair lending law compliance, reputation protection

## Competitive Positioning

| Approach | Timing | Limitation | BeTrace Complements |
|----------|--------|------------|------------------|
| **Pre-deployment testing** | Before release | Test ≠ production | ✅ Production monitoring |
| **Adversarial training** | During training | Attackers circumvent | ✅ Detect circumvention |
| **Interpretability research** | Ongoing | Severely limited | ✅ Observe behavior instead |
| **Traditional monitoring** | Production | Not behavioral | ✅ Pattern-based assurance |

**We are not competitive — we are complementary.**

## Target Buyers (Per Report)

### Primary
1. **AI Safety Institutes** (UK, EU, US)
   - Pitch: "We built the evaluation tools the report says don't exist yet"

2. **General-Purpose AI Developers** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, etc.)
   - Pitch: "Regulators will require evidence of safety. BeTrace generates it"

3. **Enterprise AI Adopters** (Healthcare, Financial, Legal)
   - Pitch: "AI failures in consequential settings are career-ending. Know what your AI does"

### Secondary
4. **Regulators & Policymakers**
   - Pitch: "Companies control pre-deployment testing. BeTrace provides independent verification"

5. **AI Safety Researchers** (Academic/Non-Profit)
   - Pitch: "We provide production trace data for safety research — what spot checks miss"

## Key Sales Messaging

### Discovery Question
"Have you read the International AI Safety Report? It identifies a critical gap BeTrace fills..."

### Core Pitch (30 seconds)
"The International AI Safety Report — 96 experts from 30+ countries — concluded that reliable mechanisms for monitoring AI systems during deployment **do not yet exist.**

We built those mechanisms.

BeTrace provides behavioral assurance through OpenTelemetry trace monitoring. We address the three gaps the report identified: testing fails, AI is inscrutable, no quantitative metrics.

Specific capabilities: AI agent monitoring, hallucination detection, bias detection — all in production where it matters."

### For Objections

**"We already have monitoring"**
→ "Traditional monitoring tracks performance. Behavioral assurance tracks whether AI follows expected patterns. The report explicitly says these are different capabilities."

**"Pre-deployment testing is sufficient"**
→ "96 experts from 30 countries concluded that spot checks 'often miss hazards' because test conditions differ from production. May I show you an example?"

**"This sounds expensive"**
→ "Compared to what? An AI incident in a consequential setting? The report shows risks emerge in leaps — by the time there's an incident, it's too late."

## Implementation Timeline

**Week 1-2**: OpenTelemetry instrumentation + pattern definition
**Week 3-4**: Real-time monitoring + baseline establishment
**Week 5+**: Compliance reporting + evidence generation

**Success Metric**: X violations detected that pre-deployment testing missed

## The Bottom Line

**The International AI Safety Report creates BeTrace's market category.**

Every challenge identified → BeTrace provides solution
Every gap described → BeTrace fills gap
Every "doesn't exist yet" → BeTrace exists

**Market validation complete. Time to execute.**
