## Analysis by Use Case

### For Sales & Business Development

**Discovery Questions**:
- See [EXECUTIVE-BRIEF.md](AI-SAFETY-REPORT-EXECUTIVE-BRIEF.md) - Sales Approach section
- See [SYNTHESIS.md](ai-safety-report-SYNTHESIS.md) - Sales Strategy section

**Pain Points by Vertical**:
- **AI Developers**: Need "evidence of safety" (see 01-ANALYSIS.md)
- **Enterprises**: Unanticipated use cases, reliability issues (see 04-ANALYSIS.md)
- **Regulators**: Information gap, monitoring mechanisms missing (see 05-ANALYSIS.md)

**Objection Handling**:
- "We already have monitoring" â†’ See EXECUTIVE-BRIEF, Objection Handling
- "Testing is sufficient" â†’ See 05-ANALYSIS (evaluation gap)
- "Too expensive" â†’ See 04-ANALYSIS (systemic risk costs)

### For Product Management

**Feature Priorities (Q1 2025)**:
1. **Agent Safety Monitoring** (see 03-ANALYSIS + 05-ANALYSIS)
   - Plan tracking, hijacking detection, goal adherence
   - Justification: "Risk management only beginning" + rapid advancement

2. **Dual-Use Detection** (see 04-ANALYSIS, section 2.1.3 + 2.1.4)
   - Cyber offense patterns, bio/chem synthesis detection
   - Justification: AI outperformed experts, company upgraded risk assessment

3. **Hallucination Detection** (see 04-ANALYSIS, section 2.2.1)
   - Source citation requirements, confidence thresholds
   - Justification: High-risk domains (medical/legal), users unaware

4. **Bias Audit Dashboard** (see 04-ANALYSIS, section 2.2.2)
   - Statistical anomaly detection, output distribution analysis
   - Justification: "New subtle forms" emerging, GDPR compliance

**Technical Architecture**:
- OpenTelemetry integration (see 03-ANALYSIS, chain-of-thought tracing)
- Pattern library structure (see all ANALYSIS docs for pattern examples)
- Cross-org threat intelligence (see 04-ANALYSIS + 05-ANALYSIS, systemic risk)

### For Marketing & Content
