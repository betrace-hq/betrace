# Section 2: Risks from General-Purpose AI

**Note**: This section is 3,901 lines from the original report. The full extracted text is available at `/tmp/section-risks.txt`. Due to size, this file contains structural outline. Request specific risk subsections for detailed analysis.

## Three Risk Categories

### 2.1 Risks from Malicious Use (lines 2343-3380)

#### 2.1.1 Harm to individuals through fake content
- **Current harms**: Deepfake pornography, AI-generated CSAM, voice impersonation fraud, blackmail, reputation sabotage
- **Evidence**: Common incident reports, but reliable statistics lacking
- **Mitigation**: Limited - watermarking can be circumvented

#### 2.1.2 Manipulation of public opinion  
- **Risk**: Persuasive content at scale for political manipulation
- **Evidence**: Limited data on prevalence and effectiveness
- **Challenge**: Technical countermeasures easily circumvented

#### 2.1.3 Cyber offence
- **Current capability**: Low-to-medium complexity cybersecurity tasks
- **State actors**: Actively exploring AI for target system surveillance
- **Update**: New research confirms advancing capabilities, but unclear impact on attacker/defender balance
- **Recent**: AI systems found/exploited vulnerabilities, discovered previously unknown vulnerability in widely-used software

#### 2.1.4 Biological and chemical attacks
- **Capability**: Instructions/troubleshooting for known weapons, design of novel toxic compounds
- **Alarming finding**: AI sometimes outperformed human experts with internet access on biological weapon planning
- **Company response**: One major AI company raised biological risk assessment from "low" to "medium"
- **Limitation**: Still requires substantial additional resources and expertise
- **Research gap**: Much relevant research is classified

### 2.2 Risks from Malfunctions (lines 3381-3907)

#### 2.2.1 Reliability issues
- **Problem**: AI generates false statements in medical/legal advice
- **User awareness**: Often unaware of limitations (low AI literacy, misleading advertising)
- **Evidence**: Known cases exist, but limited data on prevalence

#### 2.2.2 Bias
- **Types**: Race, gender, culture, age, disability, political opinion biases
- **Harms**: Discriminatory resource allocation, stereotype reinforcement, systematic neglect
- **Progress**: Mitigation techniques advancing but face trade-offs (accuracy vs. privacy)
- **Update**: New research detected additional, more subtle forms of bias

#### 2.2.3 Loss of control
- **Definition**: Hypothetical scenarios where AI operates outside anyone's control with no path to regain control
- **Consensus**: Current AI lacks capabilities for this risk
- **Expert disagreement**: Timeline ranges from "implausible" to "likely within years" to "modest-likelihood but high-severity"
- **Update**: Modest progress toward necessary capabilities (autonomous computer use, programming, unauthorized access, evading oversight)

### 2.3 Systemic Risks (lines 3908-5865)

#### 2.3.1 Labour market risks
- **Potential**: Automate very wide range of tasks
- **Impact**: Many job losses possible
- **Economist view**: Losses potentially offset by new job creation and increased demand in non-automated sectors
- **Update**: Evidence shows very rapid adoption by individuals relative to previous technologies; business adoption varies by sector

#### 2.3.2 Global AI R&D divide
- **Current state**: R&D concentrated in few Western countries and China
- **Consequence**: Increased global dependence, potential contribution to inequality
- **Root cause**: Differing compute access (LMICs have significantly less than HICs)

#### 2.3.3 Market concentration and single points of failure
- **Problem**: Small number of companies dominate
- **Risk**: Simultaneous failures across critical sectors (finance, healthcare) if all rely on same AI systems
- **Vulnerability**: Single bug or vulnerability causes broad-scale disruption

#### 2.3.4 Risks to the environment
- **Energy/resources**: Rapidly increasing compute consumption (energy, water, raw materials)
- **Trend**: No clear indication of slowing despite efficiency improvements
- **Dual use**: AI can benefit OR harm sustainability efforts

#### 2.3.5 Risks to privacy
- **Training data leaks**: Sensitive information in training data can leak during use
- **User input leaks**: Information shared with system can leak
- **Malicious use**: AI helps infer sensitive information from large datasets
- **Evidence**: No widespread privacy violations found yet
- **Update**: Deployment in sensitive contexts (healthcare, workplace monitoring) creates new risks

#### 2.3.6 Risks of copyright infringement
- **Challenge**: AI learns from and creates creative works
- **Legal**: Uncertain across jurisdictions, active litigation
- **Opacity**: Companies sharing less information about training data
- **Impact**: Makes third-party AI safety research harder
- **Update**: Copyright disputes intensifying, technical mitigations unreliable, data rights holders restricting access

### 2.4 Impact of open-weight general-purpose AI models on AI risks (lines 5866-6243)

**Open-weight models**: AI models whose central components ("weights") are shared publicly for download

**Benefits:**
- Facilitates research and innovation (including AI safety)
- Increases transparency
- Easier flaw detection by research community

**Risks:**
- Facilitates malicious/misguided use
- Developer cannot monitor or mitigate
- No way to rollback or ensure safety updates

**Consensus since Interim Report**: Risks should be evaluated as "marginal risk" - extent to which open-weight release increases/decreases risk relative to existing alternatives (closed models, other technologies)
