- [ ] 2 partnerships (standards + technical)
- [ ] Whitepaper cited in 3+ external sources
- [ ] Speaking slot at 1+ conference

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Report contributors not responsive
**Mitigation**: Focus on institutes and enterprises, use contributors for validation not pipeline

### Risk: Agent monitoring MVP not ready
**Mitigation**: Start with dual-use detection (simpler), promise agent features in roadmap

### Risk: "Do not yet exist" quote gets stale
**Mitigation**: If competitors emerge, pivot to "first-mover" + "network effects" positioning

### Risk: No design partner traction
**Mitigation**: Offer free tier, lower commitment threshold, academic research partnerships

---

## Resource Requirements

### Team
- **Sales/BD**: 1 FTE for outreach, meetings, partnerships
- **Product**: 1 FTE for agent monitoring, evidence export, demos
- **Marketing**: 0.5 FTE for content, conferences, social media
- **Eng**: 2 FTE for product development, documentation

### Budget
- **Conferences**: $10-15K (travel, booth, sponsorships)
