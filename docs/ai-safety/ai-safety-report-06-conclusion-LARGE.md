## Conclusion

The future of general-purpose AI is uncertain, with a wide range of trajectories appearing possible even in the near future, including both very positive and very negative outcomes. But nothing about the future of general-purpose AI is inevitable.

### What Depends on Human Choices

How general-purpose AI gets developed and by whom, which problems it gets designed to solve, whether societies will be able to reap general-purpose AI's full economic potential, who benefits from it, the types of risks we expose ourselves to, and how much we invest into research to manage risks â€“ these and many other questions depend on the choices that societies and governments make today and in the future to shape the development of general-purpose AI.

### Purpose of This Report

To help facilitate constructive discussion about these decisions, this report provides an overview of the current state of scientific research and discussion on managing the risks of general-purpose AI. The stakes are high. We look forward to continuing this effort.
