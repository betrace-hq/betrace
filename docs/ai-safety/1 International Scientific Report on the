Building a shared scientific understanding in a fast-moving field
I am honoured to present the International AI Safety Report. It is the
work of 96 international AI experts who collaborated in an
unprecedented effort to establish an internationally shared scientific
understanding of risks from advanced AI and methods for managing
them.
We embarked on this journey just over a year ago, shortly after the
countries present at the Bletchley Park AI Safety Summit agreed to
support the creation of this report. Since then, we published an Interim
Report in May 2024, which was presented at the AI Seoul Summit. We
are now pleased to publish the present, full report ahead of the AI
Action Summit in Paris in February 2025.
Since the Bletchley Summit, the capabilities of general-purpose AI, the
type of AI this report focuses on, have increased further. For example,
new models have shown markedly better performance at tests of
programming and scientific reasoning. In addition, many companies
are now investing in the development of general-purpose AI ‘agents’ –
systems which can autonomously plan and act to achieve goals with
little or no human oversight.
Building on the Interim Report (May 2024), the present report reflects
these new developments. In addition, the experts contributing to this
report made several other changes compared to the Interim Report.
For example, they worked to further improve the scientific rigour of all
sections, added discussion of additional topics such as open-weight
models, and restructured the report to be more relevant to
policymakers, including by highlighting evidence gaps and key
challenges for policymakers.
I extend my profound gratitude to the team of experts who
contributed to this report, including our writers, senior advisers, and
the international Expert Advisory Panel. I have been impressed with
their scientific excellence and expertise as well as the collaborative
attitude with which they have approached this challenging project. I
am also grateful to the industry and civil society organisations who
reviewed the report, contributing invaluable feedback that has led this
report to be more comprehensive than it otherwise would have been.
My thanks also go to the UK Government for starting this process and
offering outstanding operational support. It was also important for me
that the UK Government agreed that the scientists writing this report
should have complete independence.
AI remains a fast-moving field. To keep up with this pace, policymakers
and governments need to have access to the current scientific
understanding on what risks advanced AI might pose. I hope that this
report as well as future publications will help decision-makers ensure
that people around the world can reap the benefits of AI safely.

Taking advantage of AI opportunities safely calls for global
collaboration
Since the interim version of this report was published, the capabilities
of advanced AI capabilities have continued to grow. We know that this
technology, if developed and utilised safely and responsibly, offers
extraordinary opportunities: to grow our economies, modernise our
public services, and improve lives for our people. To seize these
opportunities, it is imperative that we deepen our collective
understanding of how AI can be developed safely.
This landmark report is testament to the value of global cooperation in
forging this shared understanding. It is the result of over 90 AI experts
from different continents, sectors, and areas of expertise, coming
together to offer leaders and decision-makers a global reference point
and a tool to inform policy on AI safety. Our collective understanding
of frontier AI systems has improved. However, this report highlights
that frontier AI remains a field of active scientific inquiry, with experts
continuing to disagree on its trajectory and the scope of its impact.
We will maintain the momentum behind this collective effort to drive
global scientific consensus. We are excited to continue this
unprecedented and essential project of international collaboration.
The report lays the foundation for important discussions at the AI
Action Summit in France this year, which will convene international
governments, leading AI companies, civil society groups and experts.
This Summit, like the report, is a continuation of the milestones
achieved at the Bletchley Park (November 2023) and Seoul (May
2024) summits. AI is the defining opportunity of our generation.
Together, we will continue the conversation and support bold and
ambitious action to collectively master the risks of AI and benefit from
these new technologies for the greater good. There will be no adoption
of this technology without safety: safety brings trust!
We are pleased to present this report and thank Professor Yoshua
Bengio and the writing team for the significant work that went into its
development. The UK and France look forward to continuing the
discussion at the AI Action Summit in February.

About this report
● This is the first International AI Safety Report. Following an interim publication in May 2024, a
diverse group of 96 Artificial Intelligence (AI) experts contributed to this first full report,
including an international Expert Advisory Panel nominated by 30 countries, the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European Union (EU), and the United
Nations (UN). The report aims to provide scientific information that will support informed
policymaking. It does not recommend specific policies.
● The report is the work of independent experts. Led by the Chair, the independent experts
writing this report collectively had full discretion over its content.
● While this report is concerned with AI risks and AI safety, AI also offers many potential benefits
for people, businesses, and society. There are many types of AI, each with different benefits and
risks. Most of the time, in most applications, AI helps individuals and organisations be more
effective. But people around the world will only be able to fully enjoy AI’s many potential
benefits safely if its risks are appropriately managed. This report focuses on identifying these
risks and evaluating methods for mitigating them. It does not aim to comprehensively assess all
possible societal impacts of AI, including its many potential benefits.
● The focus of the report is general-purpose AI. The report restricts its focus to a type of AI that
has advanced particularly rapidly in recent years, and whose associated risks have been less
studied and understood: general-purpose AI, or AI that can perform a wide variety of tasks. The
analysis in this report focuses on the most advanced general-purpose AI systems at the time of
writing, as well as future systems that might be even more capable.
● The report summarises the scientific evidence on three core questions: What can
general-purpose AI do? What are risks associated with general-purpose AI? And what
mitigation techniques are there against these risks?
● The stakes are high. We, the experts contributing to this report, continue to disagree on several
questions, minor and major, around general-purpose AI capabilities, risks, and risk mitigations.
But we consider this report essential for improving our collective understanding of this
technology and its potential risks. We hope that the report will help the international community
to move towards greater consensus about general-purpose AI and mitigate its risks more
effectively, so that people can safely experience its many potential benefits. The stakes are
high. We look forward to continuing this effort.

Update on latest AI advances after the writing of this
report: Chair’s note
Between the end of the writing period for this report (5 December 2024) and the publication of this
report in January 2025, an important development took place. The AI company OpenAI shared early
test results from a new AI model, o3. These results indicate significantly stronger performance than
any previous model on a number of the field’s most challenging tests of programming, abstract
reasoning, and scientific reasoning. In some of these tests, o3 outperforms many (but not all)
human experts. Additionally, it achieves a breakthrough on a key abstract reasoning test that many
experts, including myself, thought was out of reach until recently. However, at the time of writing
there is no public information about its real-world capabilities, particularly for solving more
open-ended tasks.

The o3 results are evidence that the pace of advances in AI capabilities may remain high or even
accelerate. More specifically, they suggest that giving models more computing power for solving a
given problem ('inference scaling') may help overcome previous limitations. Generally speaking,
inference scaling makes models more expensive to use. But as another recent notable model, R1,
released by the company DeepSeek in January 2025, has shown, researchers are successfully
working on lowering these costs. Overall, inference scaling may allow AI developers to make further
advances going forward. The o3 results also underscore the need to better understand how AI
developers' growing use of AI may affect the speed of further AI development itself.
The trends evidenced by o3 could have profound implications for AI risks. Advances in science and
programming capabilities have previously generated more evidence for risks such as cyber and
biological attacks. The o3 results are also relevant to potential labour market impacts, loss of
control risk, and energy use among others. But o3’s capabilities could also be used to help protect
against malfunctions and malicious uses. Overall, the risk assessments in this report should be read
with the understanding that AI has gained capabilities since the report was written. However, so far
there is no evidence yet about o3’s real world impacts, and no information to confirm nor rule out
major novel and/or immediate risks.
The improvement in capabilities suggested by the o3 results and our limited understanding of the
implications for AI risks underscore a key challenge for policymakers that this report identifies: they
will often have to weigh potential benefits and risks of imminent AI advancements without having a
large body of scientific evidence available. Nonetheless, generating evidence on the safety and
security implications of the trends implied by o3 will be an urgent priority for AI research in the
coming weeks and months.
Key findings of the report

Key findings of the report
● The capabilities of general-purpose AI, the type of AI that this report focuses on, have increased
rapidly in recent years and have improved further in recent months.† A few years ago, the best
large language models (LLMs) could rarely produce a coherent paragraph of text. Today,
general-purpose AI can write computer programs, generate custom photorealistic images, and
engage in extended open-ended conversations. Since the publication of the Interim Report
(May 2024), new models have shown markedly better performance at tests of scientific
reasoning and programming.
● Many companies are now investing in the development of general-purpose AI agents, as a
potential direction for further advancement. AI agents are general-purpose AI systems which
can autonomously act, plan, and delegate to achieve goals with little to no human oversight.
Sophisticated AI agents would be able to, for example, use computers to complete longer
projects than current systems, unlocking both additional benefits and additional risks.
● Further capability advancements in the coming months and years could be anything from slow
to extremely rapid.† Progress will depend on whether companies will be able to rapidly deploy
even more data and computational power to train new models, and whether ‘scaling’ models in
this way will overcome their current limitations. Recent research suggests that rapidly scaling
up models may remain physically feasible for at least several years. But major capability
advances may also require other factors: for example, new research breakthroughs, which are
hard to predict, or the success of a novel scaling approach that companies have recently
adopted.
● Several harms from general-purpose AI are already well established. These include scams,
non-consensual intimate imagery (NCII) and child sexual abuse material (CSAM), model outputs
that are biased against certain groups of people or certain opinions, reliability issues, and
privacy violations. Researchers have developed mitigation techniques for these problems, but
so far no combination of techniques can fully resolve them. Since the publication of the Interim
Report, new evidence of discrimination related to general-purpose AI systems has revealed
more subtle forms of bias.
● As general-purpose AI becomes more capable, evidence of additional risks is gradually
emerging. These include risks such as large-scale labour market impacts, AI-enabled hacking or
biological attacks, and society losing control over general-purpose AI. Experts interpret the
existing evidence on these risks differently: some think that such risks are decades away, while
others think that general-purpose AI could lead to societal-scale harm within the next few
years. Recent advances in general-purpose AI capabilities – particularly in tests of scientific
reasoning and programming – have generated new evidence for potential risks such as
AI-enabled hacking and biological attacks, leading one major AI company to increase its
assessment of biological risk from its best model from ‘low’ to ‘medium’.

Key findings of the report

● Risk management techniques are nascent, but progress is possible. There are various technical
methods to assess and reduce risks from general-purpose AI that developers can employ and
regulators can require, but they all have limitations. For example, current interpretability
techniques for explaining why a general-purpose AI model produced any given output remain
severely limited. However, researchers are making some progress in addressing these
limitations. In addition, researchers and policymakers are increasingly trying to standardise risk
management approaches, and to coordinate internationally.
● The pace and unpredictability of advancements in general-purpose AI pose an ‘evidence
dilemma’ for policymakers.† Given sometimes rapid and unexpected advancements,
policymakers will often have to weigh potential benefits and risks of imminent AI advancements
without having a large body of scientific evidence available. In doing so, they face a dilemma. On
the one hand, pre-emptive risk mitigation measures based on limited evidence might turn out
to be ineffective or unnecessary. On the other hand, waiting for stronger evidence of impending
risk could leave society unprepared or even make mitigation impossible – for instance if sudden
leaps in AI capabilities, and their associated risks, occur. Companies and governments are
developing early warning systems and risk management frameworks that may reduce this
dilemma. Some of these trigger specific mitigation measures when there is new evidence of
risks, while others require developers to provide evidence of safety before releasing a new
model.
● There is broad consensus among researchers that advances regarding the following questions
would be helpful: How rapidly will general-purpose AI capabilities advance in the coming years,
and how can researchers reliably measure that progress? What are sensible risk thresholds to
trigger mitigations? How can policymakers best gain access to information about
general-purpose AI that is relevant to public safety? How can researchers, technology
companies, and governments reliably assess the risks of general-purpose AI development and
deployment? How do general-purpose AI models work internally? How can general-purpose AI
be designed to behave reliably?
● AI does not happen to us: choices made by people determine its future. The future of
general-purpose AI technology is uncertain, with a wide range of trajectories appearing to be
possible even in the near future, including both very positive and very negative outcomes. This
uncertainty can evoke fatalism and make AI appear as something that happens to us. But it will
be the decisions of societies and governments on how to navigate this uncertainty that
determine which path we will take. This report aims to facilitate constructive and
evidence-based discussion about these decisions.

Executive Summary
The purpose of this report

This report synthesises the state of scientific understanding of general-purpose AI – AI that
can perform a wide variety of tasks – with a focus on understanding and managing its risks.

This report summarises the scientific evidence on the safety of general-purpose AI. The purpose of
this report is to help create a shared international understanding of risks from advanced AI and how
they can be mitigated. To achieve this, this report focuses on general-purpose AI – or AI that can
perform a wide variety of tasks – since this type of AI has advanced particularly rapidly in recent
years and has been deployed widely by technology companies for a range of consumer and
business purposes. The report synthesises the state of scientific understanding of general-purpose
AI, with a focus on understanding and managing its risks.
Amid rapid advancements, research on general-purpose AI is currently in a time of scientific
discovery, and – in many cases – is not yet settled science. The report provides a snapshot of the
current scientific understanding of general-purpose AI and its risks. This includes identifying areas
of scientific consensus and areas where there are different views or gaps in the current scientific
understanding.
People around the world will only be able to fully enjoy the potential benefits of general-purpose AI
safely if its risks are appropriately managed. This report focuses on identifying those risks and
evaluating technical methods for assessing and mitigating them, including ways that
general-purpose AI itself can be used to mitigate risks. It does not aim to comprehensively assess
all possible societal impacts of general-purpose AI. Most notably, the current and potential future
benefits of general-purpose AI – although they are vast – are beyond this report’s scope. Holistic
policymaking requires considering both the potential benefits of general-purpose AI and the risks
covered in this report. It also requires taking into account that other types of AI have different
risk/benefit profiles compared to current general-purpose AI.
The three main sections of the report summarise the scientific evidence on three core questions:
What can general-purpose AI do? What are risks associated with general-purpose AI? And what
mitigation techniques are there against these risks?
Executive Summary

Section 1 – Capabilities of general-purpose AI: What can
general-purpose AI do now and in the future?
General-purpose AI capabilities have improved rapidly in recent years, and further
advancements could be anything from slow to extremely rapid.
What AI can do is a key contributor to many of the risks it poses, and according to many metrics,
general-purpose AI capabilities have been progressing rapidly. Five years ago, the leading
general-purpose AI language models could rarely produce a coherent paragraph of text. Today,
some general-purpose AI models can engage in conversations on a wide range of topics, write
computer programs, or generate realistic short videos from a description. However, it is technically
challenging to reliably estimate and describe the capabilities of general-purpose AI.
AI developers have rapidly improved the capabilities of general-purpose AI in recent years, mostly
through ‘scaling’.† They have continually increased the resources used for training new models (this
is often referred to as ‘scaling’) and refined existing approaches to use those resources more
efficiently. For example, according to recent estimates, state-of-the-art AI models have seen
annual increases of approximately 4x in computational resources ('compute') used for training and
2.5x in training dataset size.
The pace of future progress in general-purpose AI capabilities has substantial implications for
managing emerging risks, but experts disagree on what to expect even in the coming months and
years. Experts variously support the possibility of general-purpose AI capabilities advancing slowly,
rapidly, or extremely rapidly.
Experts disagree about the pace of future progress because of different views on the promise of
further ‘scaling’ – and companies are exploring an additional, new type of scaling that might further
accelerate capabilities.† While scaling has often overcome the limitations of previous systems,
experts disagree about its potential to resolve the remaining limitations of today’s systems, such as
unreliability at acting in the physical world and at executing extended tasks on computers. In recent
months, a new type of scaling has shown potential for further improving capabilities: rather than
just scaling up the resources used for training models, AI companies are also increasingly interested
in ‘inference scaling’ – letting an already trained model use more computation to solve a given
problem, for example to improve on its own solution, or to write so-called ‘chains of thought’ that
break down the problem into simpler steps.
Several leading companies that develop general-purpose AI are betting on ‘scaling’ to continue
leading to performance improvements. If recent trends continue, by the end of 2026 some

Executive Summary

general-purpose AI models will be trained using roughly 100x more training compute than 2023's
most compute-intensive models, growing to 10,000x more training compute by 2030, combined
with algorithms that achieve greater capabilities for a given amount of available computation. In
addition to this potential scaling of training resources, recent trends such as inference scaling and
using models to generate training data could mean that even more compute will be used overall.
However, there are potential bottlenecks to further increasing both data and compute rapidly, such
as the availability of data, AI chips, capital, and local energy capacity. Companies developing
general-purpose AI are working to navigate these potential bottlenecks.
Since the publication of the Interim Report (May 2024), general-purpose AI has reached
expert-level performance in some tests and competitions for scientific reasoning and
programming, and companies have been making large efforts to develop autonomous AI agents.
Advances in science and programming have been driven by inference scaling techniques such
as writing long ‘chains of thought’. New studies suggest that further scaling such approaches,
for instance allowing models to analyse problems by writing even longer chains of thought than
today’s models, could lead to further advances in domains where reasoning matters more, such
as science, software engineering, and planning. In addition to this trend, companies are making
large efforts to develop more advanced general-purpose AI agents, which can plan and act
autonomously to work towards a given goal. Finally, the market price of using general-purpose
AI of a given capability level has dropped sharply, making this technology more broadly
accessible and widely used.
This report focuses primarily on technical aspects of AI progress, but how fast general-purpose AI
will advance is not a purely technical question. The pace of future advancements will also depend
on non-technical factors, potentially including the approaches that governments take to regulating
AI. This report does not discuss how different approaches to regulation might affect the speed of
development and adoption of general-purpose AI.
Section 2 – Risks: What are risks associated with general-purpose
AI?
Several harms from general-purpose AI are already well-established. As general-purpose AI
becomes more capable, evidence of additional risks is gradually emerging.
This report classifies general-purpose AI risks into three categories: malicious use risks; risks from
malfunctions; and systemic risks. Each of these categories contains risks that have already
materialised as well as risks that might materialise in the next few years.
Risks from malicious use: malicious actors can use general-purpose AI to cause harm to individuals,
organisations, or society. Forms of malicious use include:
Executive Summary
18
● Harm to individuals through fake content: Malicious actors can currently use
general-purpose AI to generate fake content that harms individuals in a targeted way. These
malicious uses include non-consensual 'deepfake' pornography and AI-generated CSAM,
financial fraud through voice impersonation, blackmail for extortion, sabotage of personal
and professional reputations, and psychological abuse. However, while incident reports of
harm from AI-generated fake content are common, reliable statistics on the frequency of
these incidents are still lacking.
● Manipulation of public opinion: General-purpose AI makes it easier to generate persuasive
content at scale. This can help actors who seek to manipulate public opinion, for instance to
affect political outcomes. However, evidence on how prevalent and how effective such
efforts are remains limited. Technical countermeasures like content watermarking, although
useful, can usually be circumvented by moderately sophisticated actors.
● Cyber offence: General-purpose AI can make it easier or faster for malicious actors of
varying skill levels to conduct cyberattacks. Current systems have demonstrated
capabilities in low- and medium-complexity cybersecurity tasks, and state-sponsored
actors are actively exploring AI to survey target systems. New research has confirmed that
the capabilities of general-purpose AI related to cyber offence are significantly advancing,
but it remains unclear whether this will affect the balance between attackers and defenders.
● Biological and chemical attacks: Recent general-purpose AI systems have displayed some
ability to provide instructions and troubleshooting guidance for reproducing known
biological and chemical weapons and to facilitate the design of novel toxic compounds. In
new experiments that tested for the ability to generate plans for producing biological
weapons, a general-purpose AI system sometimes performed better than human experts
with access to the internet. In response, one AI company increased its assessment of
biological risk from its best model from ‘low’ to ‘medium’. However, real-world attempts to
develop such weapons still require substantial additional resources and expertise. A
comprehensive assessment of biological and chemical risk is difficult because much of the
relevant research is classified.
Since the publication of the Interim Report, general-purpose AI has become more capable in
domains that are relevant for malicious use. For example, researchers have recently built
general-purpose AI systems that were able to find and exploit some cybersecurity
vulnerabilities on their own and, with human assistance, discover a previously unknown
vulnerability in widely used software. General-purpose AI capabilities related to reasoning and
to integrating different types of data, which can aid research on pathogens or in other dual-use
fields, have also improved.
Risks from malfunctions: general-purpose AI can also cause unintended harm. Even when users
have no intention to cause harm, serious risks can arise due to the malfunctioning of
general-purpose AI. Such malfunctions include:
Executive Summary
19
● Reliability issues: Current general-purpose AI can be unreliable, which can lead to harm. For
example, if users consult a general-purpose AI system for medical or legal advice, the
system might generate an answer that contains falsehoods. Users are often not aware of the
limitations of an AI product, for example due to limited ‘AI literacy’, misleading advertising, or
miscommunication. There are a number of known cases of harm from reliability issues, but
still limited evidence on exactly how widespread different forms of this problem are.
● Bias: General-purpose AI systems can amplify social and political biases, causing concrete
harm. They frequently display biases with respect to race, gender, culture, age, disability,
political opinion, or other aspects of human identity. This can lead to discriminatory
outcomes including unequal resource allocation, reinforcement of stereotypes, and
systematic neglect of underrepresented groups or viewpoints. Technical approaches for
mitigating bias and discrimination in general-purpose AI systems are advancing, but face
trade-offs between bias mitigation and competing objectives such as accuracy and privacy,
as well as other challenges.
● Loss of control: ‘Loss of control’ scenarios are hypothetical future scenarios in which one or
more general-purpose AI systems come to operate outside of anyone's control, with no
clear path to regaining control. There is broad consensus that current general-purpose AI
lacks the capabilities to pose this risk. However, expert opinion on the likelihood of loss of
control within the next several years varies greatly: some consider it implausible, some
consider it likely to occur, and some see it as a modest-likelihood risk that warrants
attention due to its high potential severity. Ongoing empirical and mathematical research is
gradually advancing these debates.
Since the publication of the Interim Report, new research has led to some new insights about
risks of bias and loss of control. The evidence of bias in general-purpose AI systems has
increased, and recent work has detected additional forms of AI bias. Researchers have
observed modest further advancements towards AI capabilities that are likely necessary for
commonly discussed loss of control scenarios to occur. These include capabilities for
autonomously using computers, programming, gaining unauthorised access to digital systems,
and identifying ways to evade human oversight.
Systemic risks: beyond the risks directly posed by capabilities of individual models, widespread
deployment of general-purpose AI is associated with several broader systemic risks. Examples of
systemic risks range from potential labour market impacts to privacy risks and environmental
effects:
● Labour market risks: General-purpose AI, especially if it continues to advance rapidly, has
the potential to automate a very wide range of tasks, which could have a significant effect
on the labour market. This means that many people could lose their current jobs. However,
many economists expect that potential job losses could be offset, partly or potentially even
completely, by the creation of new jobs and by increased demand in non-automated
sectors.
Executive Summary
20
● Global AI R&D divide: General-purpose AI research and development (R&D) is currently
concentrated in a few Western countries and China. This ‘AI divide’ has the potential to
increase much of the world’s dependence on this small set of countries. Some experts also
expect it to contribute to global inequality. The divide has many causes, including a number
of causes that are not unique to AI. However, in significant part it stems from differing levels
of access to the very expensive compute needed to develop general-purpose AI: most
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have significantly less access to compute than
high-income countries (HICs).
● Market concentration and single points of failure: A small number of companies currently
dominate the market for general-purpose AI. This market concentration could make
societies more vulnerable to several systemic risks. For instance, if organisations across
critical sectors, such as finance or healthcare, all rely on a small number of general-purpose
AI systems, then a bug or vulnerability in such a system could cause simultaneous failures
and disruptions on a broad scale.
● Environmental risks: Growing compute use in general-purpose AI development and
deployment has rapidly increased the amounts of energy, water, and raw material consumed
in building and operating the necessary compute infrastructure. This trend shows no clear
indication of slowing, despite progress in techniques that allow compute to be used more
efficiently. General-purpose AI also has a number of applications that can either benefit or
harm sustainability efforts.
● Privacy risks: General-purpose AI can cause or contribute to violations of user privacy. For
example, sensitive information that was in the training data can leak unintentionally when a
user interacts with the system. In addition, when users share sensitive information with the
system, this information can also leak. But general-purpose AI can also facilitate deliberate
violations of privacy, for example if malicious actors use AI to infer sensitive information
about specific individuals from large amounts of data. However, so far, researchers have not
found evidence of widespread privacy violations associated with general-purpose AI.
● Copyright infringements: General-purpose AI both learns from and creates works of creative
expression, challenging traditional systems of data consent, compensation, and control. Data
collection and content generation can implicate a variety of data rights laws, which vary
across jurisdictions and may be under active litigation. Given the legal uncertainty around
data collection practices, AI companies are sharing less information about the data they use.
This opacity makes third-party AI safety research harder.
Since the publication of the Interim Report, additional evidence on the labour market impacts of
general-purpose AI has emerged, while new developments have heightened privacy and
copyrights concerns. New analyses of labour market data suggest that individuals are adopting
general-purpose AI very rapidly relative to previous technologies. The pace of adoption by
businesses varies widely by sector. In addition, recent advances in capabilities have led to
general-purpose AI being deployed increasingly in sensitive contexts such as healthcare or
workplace monitoring, which creates new privacy risks. Finally, as copyright disputes intensify 
Executive Summary
21
and technical mitigations to copyright infringements remain unreliable, data rights holders have
been rapidly restricting access to their data.
Open-weight models: an important factor in evaluating many risks that a general-purpose AI model
might pose is how it is released to the public. So-called ‘open-weight models’ are AI models whose
central components, called ‘weights’, are shared publicly for download. Open-weight access
facilitates research and innovation, including in AI safety, as well as increasing transparency and
making it easier for the research community to detect flaws in models. However, open-weight
models can also pose risks, for example by facilitating malicious or misguided use that is difficult or
impossible for the developer of the model to monitor or mitigate. Once model weights are available
for public download, there is no way to implement a wholesale rollback of all existing copies or
ensure that all existing copies receive safety updates. Since the Interim Report, high-level
consensus has emerged that risks posed by greater AI openness should be evaluated in terms of
‘marginal’ risk: the extent to which releasing an open-weight model would increase or decrease a
given risk, relative to risks posed by existing alternatives such as closed models or other
technologies.
Section 3 – Risk management: What techniques are there for
managing risks from general-purpose AI?
Several technical approaches can help manage risks, but in many cases the best available
approaches still have highly significant limitations and no quantitative risk estimation or guarantees
that are available in other safety-critical domains.
Risk management – identifying and assessing risks, and then mitigating and monitoring them – is
difficult in the context of general-purpose AI. Although risk management has also been highly
challenging in many other domains, there are some features of general-purpose AI that appear to
create distinctive difficulties.
Several technical features of general-purpose AI make risk management in this domain particularly
difficult. They include, among others:
● The range of possible uses and use contexts for general-purpose AI systems is unusually
broad. For example, the same system may be used to provide medical advice, analyse
computer code for vulnerabilities, and generate photos. This increases the difficulty of
comprehensively anticipating relevant use cases, identifying risks, or testing how systems
will behave in relevant real-world circumstances.
● Developers still understand little about how their general-purpose AI models operate. This
lack of understanding makes it more difficult both to predict behavioural issues and to
explain and resolve known issues once they are observed. Understanding remains elusive
mainly because general-purpose AI models are not programmed in the traditional sense. 
Executive Summary
22
Instead, they are trained: AI developers set up a training process that involves a large volume
of data, and the outcome of that training process is the general-purpose AI model. The inner
workings of these models are largely inscrutable, including to the model developers. Model
explanation and ‘interpretability’ techniques can improve researchers’ and developers’
understanding of how general-purpose AI models operate, but, despite recent progress, this
research remains nascent.
● Increasingly capable AI agents – general-purpose AI systems that can autonomously act,
plan, and delegate to achieve goals – will likely present new, significant challenges for risk
management. AI agents typically work towards goals autonomously by using general
software such as web browsers and programming tools. Currently, most are not yet reliable
enough for widespread use, but companies are making large efforts to build more capable
and reliable AI agents and have made progress in recent months. AI agents will likely become
increasingly useful, but may also exacerbate a number of the risks discussed in this report
and introduce additional difficulties for risk management. Examples of such potential new
challenges include the possibility that users might not always know what their own AI agents
are doing, the potential for AI agents to operate outside of anyone’s control, the potential for
attackers to ‘hijack’ agents, and the potential for AI-to-AI interactions to create complex
new risks. Approaches for managing risks associated with agents are only beginning to be
developed.
Besides technical factors, several economic, political, and other societal factors make risk
management in the field of general-purpose AI particularly difficult.
● The pace of advancement in general-purpose AI creates an 'evidence dilemma' for
decision-makers.† Rapid capability advancement makes it possible for some risks to emerge
in leaps; for example, the risk of academic cheating using general-purpose AI shifted from
negligible to widespread within a year. The more quickly a risk emerges, the more difficult it
is to manage the risk reactively and the more valuable preparation becomes. However, so
long as evidence for a risk remains incomplete, decision-makers also cannot know for sure
whether the risk will emerge or perhaps even has already emerged. This creates a trade-off:
implementing pre-emptive or early mitigation measures might prove unnecessary, but
waiting for conclusive evidence could leave society vulnerable to risks that emerge rapidly.
Companies and governments are developing early warning systems and risk management
frameworks that may reduce this dilemma. Some of these trigger specific mitigation
measures when there is new evidence of risks, while others require developers to provide
evidence of safety before releasing a new model.
● There is an information gap between what AI companies know about their AI systems and
what governments and non-industry researchers know. Companies often share only limited
information about their general-purpose AI systems, especially in the period before they are
widely released. Companies cite a mixture of commercial concerns and safety concerns as
† Please refer to the Chair's update on the latest AI advances after the writing of this report.
Executive Summary
23
reasons to limit information sharing. However, this information gap also makes it more
challenging for other actors to participate effectively in risk management, especially for
emerging risks.
● Both AI companies and governments often face strong competitive pressure, which may
lead them to deprioritise risk management. In some circumstances, competitive pressure
may incentivise companies to invest less time or other resources into risk management than
they otherwise would. Similarly, governments may invest less in policies to support risk
management in cases where they perceive trade-offs between international competition
and risk reduction.
Nonetheless, there are various techniques and frameworks for managing risks from
general-purpose AI that companies can employ and regulators can require. These include methods
for identifying and assessing risks, as well as methods for mitigating and monitoring them.
● Assessing general-purpose AI systems for risks is an integral part of risk management, but
existing risk assessments are severely limited. Existing evaluations of general-purpose AI risk
mainly rely on ‘spot checks’, i.e. testing the behaviour of a general-purpose AI in a set of
specific situations. This can help surface potential hazards before deploying a model.
However, existing tests often miss hazards and overestimate or underestimate
general-purpose AI capabilities and risks, because test conditions differ from the real world.
● For risk identification and assessment to be effective, evaluators need substantial expertise,
resources, and sufficient access to relevant information. Rigorous risk assessment in the
context of general-purpose AI requires combining multiple evaluation approaches. These
range from technical analyses of the models and systems themselves to evaluations of
possible risks from certain use patterns. Evaluators need substantial expertise to conduct
such evaluations correctly. For comprehensive risk assessments, they often also need more
time, more direct access to the models and their training data, and more information about
the technical methodologies used than the companies developing general-purpose AI
typically provide.
● There has been progress in training general-purpose AI models to function more safely, but
no current method can reliably prevent even overtly unsafe outputs. For example, a
technique called ‘adversarial training’ involves deliberately exposing AI models to examples
designed to make them fail or misbehave during training, aiming to build resistance to such
cases. However, adversaries can still find new ways ('attacks') to circumvent these
safeguards with low to moderate effort. In addition, recent evidence suggests that current
training methods – which rely heavily on imperfect human feedback – may inadvertently
incentivise models to mislead humans on difficult questions by making errors harder to spot.
Improving the quantity and quality of this feedback is an avenue for progress, though
nascent training techniques using AI to detect misleading behaviour also show promise.
● Monitoring – identifying risks and evaluating performance once a model is already in use –
and various interventions to prevent harmful actions can improve the safety of a
general-purpose AI after it is deployed to users. Current tools can detect AI-generated 
Executive Summary
24
content, track system performance, and identify potentially harmful inputs/outputs, though
moderately skilled users can often circumvent these safeguards. Several layers of defence
that combine technical monitoring and intervention capabilities with human oversight
improve safety but can introduce costs and delays. In the future, hardware-enabled
mechanisms could help customers and regulators to monitor general-purpose AI systems
more effectively during deployment and potentially help verify agreements across borders,
but reliable mechanisms of this kind do not yet exist.
● Multiple methods exist across the AI lifecycle to safeguard privacy. These include removing
sensitive information from training data, model training approaches that control how much
information is learned from data (such as ‘differential privacy’ approaches), and techniques
for using AI with sensitive data that make it hard to recover the data (such as ‘confidential
computing’ and other privacy-enhancing technologies). Many privacy-enhancing methods
from other research fields are not yet applicable to general-purpose AI systems due to the
computational requirements of AI systems. In recent months, privacy protection methods
have expanded to address AI's growing use in sensitive domains including smartphone
assistants, AI agents, always-listening voice assistants, and use in healthcare or legal
practice.
Since the publication of the Interim Report, researchers have made some further progress
towards being able to explain why a general-purpose AI model has produced a given output.
Being able to explain AI decisions could help manage risks from malfunctions ranging from bias
and factual inaccuracy to loss of control. In addition, there have been growing efforts to
standardise assessment and mitigation approaches around the world.
Conclusion: A wide range of trajectories for the future of
general-purpose AI are possible, and much will depend on how
societies and governments act
The future of general-purpose AI is uncertain, with a wide range of trajectories appearing possible
even in the near future, including both very positive and very negative outcomes. But nothing about
the future of general-purpose AI is inevitable. How general-purpose AI gets developed and by
whom, which problems it gets designed to solve, whether societies will be able to reap
general-purpose AI’s full economic potential, who benefits from it, the types of risks we expose
ourselves to, and how much we invest into research to manage risks – these and many other
questions depend on the choices that societies and governments make today and in the future to
shape the development of general-purpose AI.
To help facilitate constructive discussion about these decisions, this report provides an overview of
the current state of scientific research and discussion on managing the risks of general-purpose AI.
The stakes are high. We look forward to continuing this effort.

Introduction
We are in the midst of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work,
and relate to one another. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to transform many aspects of our
society and economy.
The capabilities of AI systems have improved rapidly in many domains over the last years. Large
language models (LLMs) are a particularly salient example. In 2019, GPT-2, then the most advanced
LLM, could not reliably produce a coherent paragraph of text and could not always count to ten.
Five years later, at the time of writing, the most powerful LLMs, such as GPT-4, o1, Claude 3.5
Sonnet, Hunyuan-Large, and Gemini 1.5 Pro, can engage consistently in multi-turn conversations,
write short computer programs, translate between multiple languages, score highly on university
entrance exams, and summarise long documents.
Because of these advances, AI is now increasingly present in our lives and is deployed in
increasingly consequential settings across many domains. Just over the last two years, there has
been rapid growth in AI adoption – ChatGPT, for instance, is amongst the fastest growing
technology applications in history, reaching over one million users just five days after its launch, and
100 million users in two months. AI is now being integrated into search engines, legal databases,
clinical decision support tools, and many more products and services.
The step-change in AI capabilities and adoption, and the potential for continued progress, could
help advance the public interest in many ways – but there are risks. Among the most promising
prospects are AI’s potential for education, medical applications, research advances in fields such as
chemistry, biology, or physics, and generally increased prosperity thanks to AI-enabled innovation.
Along with this rapid progress, experts are becoming increasingly aware of current harms and
potential future risks associated with the most capable types of AI.
This report aims to contribute to an internationally shared scientific understanding of advanced AI
safety. To work towards a shared international understanding of the risks of advanced AI,
government representatives and leaders from academia, business, and civil society convened in
Bletchley Park in the United Kingdom in November 2023 for the first international AI Safety Summit.
At the Summit, the nations present agreed to support the development of an International AI Safety
Report. This report will be presented at the AI Action Summit held in Paris in February 2025. An
interim version of this report was published in May 2024 and presented at the AI Seoul Summit. At
the Summit and in the weeks and months that followed, the experts writing this report received
extensive feedback from scientists, companies, civil society organisations, and policymakers. This
input has strongly informed the writing of the present report, which builds on the Interim Report
and is the first full International AI Safety Report.
Introduction
26
An international group of 96 AI experts, representing a breadth of views and, where relevant, a
diversity of backgrounds, contributed to this report. They considered a range of relevant scientific,
technical, and socio-economic evidence published before 5 December 2024. Since the field of AI is
developing rapidly, not all sources used for this report are peer-reviewed. However, the report is
committed to citing only high-quality sources. Indicators for a source being of high quality include:
● The piece constitutes an original contribution that advances the field.
● The piece engages comprehensively with the existing scientific literature, references the
work of others where appropriate, and interprets it accurately.
● The piece discusses possible objections to its claims in good faith.
● The piece clearly describes the methods employed for its analysis. It critically discusses the
choice of methods.
● The piece clearly highlights its methodological limitations.
● The piece has been influential in the scientific community.
Since, at the time of writing this report, a scientific consensus on the risks from advanced AI is still
being forged, in many cases the report does not put forward confident views. Rather, it offers a
snapshot of the current state of scientific understanding and consensus, or lack thereof. Where
there are gaps in the literature, the report identifies them, in the hope that this will be a spur to
further research.
This report does not comment on which policies might be appropriate responses to AI risks. It aims
to be highly relevant for AI policy, but not in any way prescriptive. Ultimately, policymakers have to
choose how to balance the opportunities and risks that advanced AI poses. Policymakers must also
choose the appropriate level of prudence and caution in response to risks that remain ambiguous.
The report focuses on ‘general-purpose’ AI – AI that can perform a wide range of tasks. AI is the
field of computer science focused on creating systems or machines capable of performing tasks
that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving,
natural language processing, and decision making. AI research is a broad and quickly evolving field
of study, and there are many kinds of AI. This report does not address all potential risks from all
types of advanced AI. It focuses on general-purpose AI, or AI that can perform a wide range of
tasks. General-purpose AI, now known to many through applications such as ChatGPT, has
generated unprecedented interest in AI, both among the public and policymakers, in the last two
years. The capabilities of general-purpose AI have been improving particularly rapidly.
General-purpose AI is different from so-called 'narrow AI’, a kind of AI that is specialised to perform
one specific task or a few very similar tasks.
To better understand how this report defines general-purpose AI, it is useful to make a distinction
between ‘AI models’ and ‘AI systems’. AI models can be thought of as the raw, mathematical
essence that is often the ‘engine’ of AI applications. An AI system is a combination of several 
Introduction
27
components, including one or more AI models, that is designed to be particularly useful to humans
in some way. For example, the ChatGPT app is an AI system; its core engine, GPT-4, is an AI model.
The report covers risks both from general-purpose AI models and from general-purpose AI
systems. For the purposes of this report:
● An AI model is a general-purpose AI model if it can perform, or can be adapted to perform, a
wide variety of tasks. If such a model is adapted to primarily perform a narrower set of tasks,
it still counts as a general-purpose AI model.
● An AI system is a general-purpose AI system if it is based on a general-purpose AI model.
‘Adapting a model’ here refers to using techniques such as fine-tuning a model (training an already
pre-trained model on a dataset that is significantly smaller than the previous dataset used for
training), prompting it in specific ways (‘prompt engineering’), and techniques for integrating the
model into a broader system.
Large generative AI models and systems, such as chatbots based on LLMs, are well-known
examples of general-purpose AI. They allow for flexible generation of output that can readily
accommodate a wide range of distinct tasks. General-purpose AI also includes AIs that can perform
a wide range of sufficiently distinct tasks within a specific domain such as structural biology.
Within the domain of general-purpose AI, this report focuses on general-purpose AI that is at least
as capable as today’s most advanced general-purpose AI. Examples include GPT-4o, AlphaFold-3,
and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Note that in this report’s definition, a model or system does not need to have
multiple modalities – for example, speech, text, and images – to be considered general-purpose.
What matters is the ability to perform a wide variety of tasks, which can also be accomplished by a
model or system with only one modality.
General-purpose AI is not to be confused with ‘artificial general intelligence’ (AGI). The term AGI
lacks a universal definition but is typically used to refer to a potential future AI that equals or
surpasses human performance on all or almost all cognitive tasks. By contrast, several of today’s AI
models and systems already meet the criteria for counting as general-purpose AI as defined in this
report.
This report does not address risks from ‘narrow AI’, which is trained to perform a specific task and
captures a correspondingly very limited body of knowledge. The focus on advanced
general-purpose AI is due to progress in this field having been most rapid, and the associated risks
being less studied and understood. Narrow AI, however, can also be highly relevant from a risk and
safety perspective, and evidence relating to the risks of these systems is used across the report.
Narrow AI models and systems are used in a vast range of products and services in fields such as
medicine, advertising, or banking, and can pose significant risks. These risks can lead to harms such
as biased hiring decisions, car crashes, or harmful medical treatment recommendations. Narrow AI 
Introduction
28
is also used in various military applications, for instance; Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems
(LAWS) (1). Such topics are covered in other fora and are outside the scope of this report. The
scope of potential future reports is not yet decided.
A large and diverse group of leading international experts contributed to this report, including
representatives nominated by 30 nations from all UN Regional Groups, as well as the OECD, the EU,
and the UN. While our individual views sometimes differ, we share the conviction that constructive
scientific and public discourse on AI is necessary for people around the world to reap the benefits
of this technology safely. We hope that this report can contribute to that discourse and be a
foundation for future reports that will gradually improve our shared understanding of the
capabilities and risks of advanced AI.
The report is organised into five main sections: After this Introduction, 1. Capabilities of
general-purpose AI provides information on the current capabilities of general-purpose AI,
underlying principles, and potential future trends. 2. Risks discusses risks associated with
general-purpose AI. 3. Technical approaches to risk management presents technical approaches to
mitigating risks from general-purpose AI and evaluates their strengths and limitations. The
Conclusion summarises and concludes.

1.1. How general-purpose AI is developed
KEY INFORMATION
● General-purpose AI can perform, and help users accomplish, a wide variety of tasks. For
example, it can produce text, images, video, audio, actions, or annotations for data.
● General-purpose AI is based on ‘deep learning’. Deep learning leverages large amounts of
computational resources for an AI model to learn useful patterns from a large amount of
training data.
● The lifecycle of a general-purpose AI can be divided into distinct stages. These stages are:
○ Data collection and pre-processing: developers and data workers collect, clean, label,
standardise, and transform raw training data into a format the model can effectively
learn from.
○ Pre-training: developers feed AI models vast quantities of data to instil general
knowledge by learning from examples. This stage currently requires the most
computation.
○ Fine-tuning: developers and contracted data workers further refine the pre-trained
‘base model’ in a process called ‘fine-tuning’ to optimise the model’s performance for a
specific application or make it more useful generally. This stage can be very labour
intensive.
○ System integration: developers combine one or more general-purpose AI models with
other components, such as user interfaces or content filters, to enhance capability and
safety and to produce a full ‘AI system’ that is ready for use.
○ Deployment: developers make the integrated AI system available for others to use by
implementing the AI system into real-world applications or services.
○ Post-deployment monitoring: developers gather and analyse user feedback, track
performance metrics, and make iterative improvements to address issues or
limitations discovered during real-world use. These improvements can include more
fine-tuning or updating the system integration.
● Since the publication of the Interim Report (May 2024), the abilities of general-purpose AI
at tests of multi-step reasoning have improved. This is largely due to fine-tuning
techniques through which a model learns to approach problems in a more structured way
before it generates an output.
Key Definitions
● Model: A computer program, often based on machine learning, designed to process inputs
and generate outputs. AI models can perform tasks such as prediction, classification,
decision-making, or generation, forming the core of AI applications.
Capabilities of general-purpose AI
1.1 How general-purpose AI is developed
31
● System: An integrated setup that combines one or more AI models with other components,
such as user interfaces or content filters, to produce an application that users can interact
with.
● Compute: Shorthand for ‘computational resources’, which refers to the hardware (e.g.
graphics processing units (GPUs)), software (e.g. data management software) and
infrastructure (e.g. data centres) required to train and run AI systems.
● Deep learning: A machine learning technique in which large amounts of data and compute
are used to train multilayered, artificial neural networks (inspired by biological brains) to
automatically learn and extract high-level features from large datasets, enabling powerful
pattern recognition and decision-making capabilities.
● Developer: Any organisation that designs, builds, integrates, adapts or combines AI models
or systems.
● Neural network: A type of AI model consisting of a mathematical structure that is inspired by
the human brain and composed of interconnected nodes (like neurons) that process and
learn from data. Current general-purpose AI systems are based on neural networks.
● Weights: Model parameters that represent the strength of connection between nodes in a
neural network. Weights play an important part in determining the output of a model in
response to a given input and are iteratively updated during model training to improve its
performance.
‘General-purpose AI’ refers to artificial intelligence models or systems that can perform a wide
range of tasks rather than being specialised for one specific function. While all AI operates on a
fundamental input-to-output basis – processing data to generate results – general-purpose AI
distinguishes itself by its ability to handle a diverse range of tasks, e.g. summarising text, generating
images, or writing computer code (for a more detailed definition of general-purpose AI, see
Introduction). This versatility makes it useful, allowing applications in numerous fields such as
healthcare, finance, and engineering. However, these capabilities also present new challenges,
particularly in ensuring safety and ethical use. The complexity of managing multiple potential use
cases increases the potential for unintended consequences, biases, and misuse.
Examples of general-purpose AI include:
● Language models, such as o1 (2*), GPT-4o (3*), Gemini-1.5 (4*), Claude-3.5 (5*), Command
r+ (6*), Qwen2.5 (7*), the ERNIE family (8*), Hunyuan-Large (9*), Yi-Lightning (10*), Llama-3.1
(11*), and Mistral Large (12*).
● Image generators (13), such as DALL-E 3 (14*) and Stable Diffusion-3 (15*).
● Video generators such as SORA (16*), Pika (17), and Runway (17).
● Robotics and navigation systems, such as PaLM-E (18) and Octo (19*).
● AI agents that can accomplish relatively complex tasks in pursuit of a goal with little human
involvement, such as AutoGPT (20), Sibyl (21*) and ‘The AI Scientist’ (22*).
● Predictors of biomolecular structures, such as AlphaFold-3 (23).
Capabilities of general-purpose AI
1.1 How general-purpose AI is developed
32
General-purpose AI models are developed via a process called ‘deep learning’. Deep learning is a
paradigm of AI development focused on building computer systems that learn from examples.
Instead of programming specific rules into systems, researchers feed these systems examples –
such as pictures, texts, or sounds – and they gradually learn to recognise patterns and make sense
of new information. Deep learning started emerging as a dominant paradigm for AI development in
the early 2010s. It was solidified as the primary paradigm after notable developments such as the
victory of the AlphaGo system against the world’s leading Go player in 2016.
Figure 1.1: Today's general-purpose AI models are neural networks, which are inspired by the animal brain. These networks
are composed of connected nodes, where the strength of connections between nodes are called 'weights'. Weights are
updated through iterative training with large quantities of data. Source: International AI Safety Report.
There are many different types of general-purpose AI, but they are developed using common
methods and principles. Deep learning works by processing data through ‘layers’ of interconnected
mathematical nodes (see Figure 1.1), often called ‘neurons’ because they are loosely inspired by
neurons in biological brains (‘neural networks’) (24). As information flows from one layer of neurons
to the next, the model refines its representations. For example, in a vision system, the first layers
might detect simple features such as edges or basic shapes in an image, while deeper layers
combine these features to recognise more complex patterns like faces or objects. When the
system makes mistakes, deep learning algorithms adjust the strength of various connections
between neurons to improve the model’s performance. The strength of each connection between
nodes is often called a ‘weight’. This layered approach to learning is what gives deep learning its
name, and it is effective at tasks that previously required human intelligence. Most state-of-the-art
general-purpose AI models are now based on a specific neural network architecture known as the
'Transformer' (25), which is able to process large quantities of data simultaneously. Transformers

have been very effective at learning from large amounts of data, leading to significant
improvements in translation and text generation and eventually leading to the development of LLMs
such as GPT-4o.

The process of developing and deploying general-purpose AI follows a series of distinct stages.
These stages occur at different points in time, depend on different resources, require different
techniques, and are sometimes undertaken by different developers (see Figure 1.2 / Table 1.1). As a
result, different policies and regulations affecting data, computational resources (‘compute’), or
human oversight may affect each stage differently.

Figure 1.2: The process of developing and deploying general-purpose AI follows a series of distinct stages, from data
collection and pre-processing to post-deployment monitoring. Source: International AI Safety Report.
Before training a general-purpose AI model, developers collect and prepare suitable data, which is
a large-scale operation. Creating high-quality training datasets involves complex pipelines of data
collection, cleaning, and curation. The training datasets behind state-of-the-art models comprise
an immense number of examples from across the internet. Teams often develop sophisticated
filtering systems to reduce inappropriate or harmful content, eliminate duplicate data, and improve
representation across different topics and perspectives. Data pre-processing can also help reduce
copyright and privacy concerns, handle multiple languages and formats, and improve
documentation for data provenance. Many companies employ large teams of annotators and
subject matter experts to verify and label portions of the data, develop classification systems for
content quality, and create specialised datasets for specific capabilities.
Data collection
and
pre-processing
Developers collect, clean, label, standardise, and transform raw training data into a
format the model can learn from. This is a highly labour-intensive process.
Pre-training Developers feed models massive amounts of diverse data – such as text, code,
and images – to instil general knowledge. Pre-training produces a ‘base model’.
This is a highly compute-intensive process.
Fine-tuning Developers further train the base model to optimise it for a specific application or
make it more useful generally. This is typically done with the help of a large amount
of human-generated feedback. This is a moderately compute-intensive and highly
labour-intensive process.

components such as user interfaces or content filters to create a full ‘AI system’
that is ready for use.

Post-deployment

Developers gather and analyse user feedback, track impact and performance
metrics, and make iterative improvements to address issues or limitations
discovered during real-world use.
Table 1.1: At each stage of the AI lifecycle, the AI model is improved for downstream use and eventually deployed as a
fully integrated AI system.
During pre-training, developers present general-purpose AI models with large amounts of data,
which allows the model to learn patterns. At the beginning of the training process, an untrained
model produces random outputs. However, through exposure to millions or billions of examples –
such as pictures, texts, or audio – the model gradually learns facts and patterns which allow it to
make sense of information in context. Pre-training produces a ‘base model’ with general
background knowledge and capabilities.
Pre-training for general-purpose AI models is often the most computationally intensive stage of
development. The pre-training process takes weeks or months and uses tens of thousands of
graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs) – specialised computer chips
designed to rapidly process many calculations. Today, this process uses roughly 10 billion times
more compute compared to state-of-the-art model training in 2010 (26). Some developers
conduct pre-training with their own compute, while others use resources provided by specialised
compute providers. Either way, energy costs are high, and it is projected that for the largest
general-purpose AI models, pre-training compute costs alone will exceed $1 billion for some models
by 2027 (27). See 2.3.4. Risks to the environment for a discussion of the environmental costs of
training.
After pre-training, general-purpose AI models learn from specially curated feedback and
specialised data sets to improve model performance and efficiency – a process called ‘fine-tuning’.
After pre-training, most general-purpose AI models undergo one or more additional fine-tuning
stages to refine their ability to accomplish the intended tasks. Fine-tuning can include various
techniques, including learning from desirable examples (28, 29) or from positive/negative
reinforcement (30, 31*). In some ways, fine-tuning a general-purpose AI can be compared to
teaching a student through practice and feedback. Often, fine-tuning follows this scheme:
1. researchers give a base model tasks that it then tries to solve; 2. the researchers then mark good
responses as positive examples and mistakes are marked as negative examples; 3. the model is
then updated such that it tends to favour approaches that worked well and avoid those that did
not, gradually becoming more reliable. Overall, fine-tuning improves the performance of
general-purpose AI models by allowing them to utilise existing knowledge and capabilities to
accomplish the desired task. Fine-tuning is traditionally the most labour-intensive training step, 
Capabilities of general-purpose AI
1.1 How general-purpose AI is developed
35
often requiring feedback from thousands of contracted data workers. However, general-purpose AI
systems are themselves increasingly being used to help fine-tune other general-purpose models
(32*, 33*). In practice, fine-tuning is typically an iterative process in which developers will alternate
between fine-tuning and testing runs until their tests show that the system meets desired
specifications.
After fine-tuning comes ‘system integration’, which involves combining general-purpose AI models
with other components such as user interfaces or content filters to produce a general-purpose AI
system. A general-purpose AI system is a combination of one or more general-purpose AI models
and all the additional components needed to make them operational – such as user interfaces, data
processing infrastructure, and various tools. For example, GPT-4o is a general-purpose AI model
that processes text, images, and audio. However, ChatGPT is a general-purpose AI system that
combines the GPT-4o model with a chat interface, content processing, web access, and application
integration to create a functional product. The additional components in an AI system also aim to
enhance capability, usefulness, and safety. For example, a system might come with a filter that
detects and blocks model inputs or outputs that contain harmful content. Developers are also
increasingly designing so-called ‘scaffolding’ around general-purpose AI models that allows them to
plan ahead, pursue goals, and interact with the world (see 1.2. Current capabilities). Just like
fine-tuning, system integration typically involves alternating integration and testing steps. The final
step before deployment is typically to construct a report on the system’s development,
capabilities, and test results. This is often known as a ‘system card’ (34).
After system integration, ‘deployment’ makes AI systems available for use. Deployment is the
process of implementing AI systems into real-world applications, products, or services where they
can serve requests and operate within a larger context. Deployment can take several forms: internal
deployment for use by the system’s developer, or external deployment either publicly or to private
customers. Very little is publicly known about internal deployments. However, companies are known
to adopt different types of strategies for external deployment. For example, companies often offer
access through online user interfaces or integrations that allow their models to be used with
custom applications designed by downstream developers. These integrations can allow for one
developer’s general-purpose AI systems to be used in numerous other applications. For example,
one company might design a bespoke customer service chatbot that is powered by another
company’s general-purpose AI system.
‘Deployment’ and ‘model release’ are distinct activities that are easily confused. ‘Deployment’
involves putting an integrated AI system into use as described above. ‘Model release’, on the other
hand, involves making trained models available for downstream entities to further use, study,
modify, and/or integrate into their own systems. There is a spectrum of model release options
ranging from fully closed to fully open (35*). Fully closed models are maintained for internal
research and development only. Fully open models are those for which all model components (e.g.
weights, code, training data) and documentation are made freely available under an open source
licence for anyone to use, study, share, or modify (36*). Some state-of-the-art general-purpose AI 
Capabilities of general-purpose AI
1.1 How general-purpose AI is developed
36
models, such as GPT-4o (3*), are on the closed end of the spectrum, while others sit more towards
the open end of the spectrum. For example, Llama-3.1 (37*) has ‘open’ weights that are available for
public download. From a risk mitigation perspective, there are advantages and disadvantages of
more open forms of model release (see 2.4. Impact of open-weight general-purpose AI models on
AI risks).
After deployment, developers can engage in ‘monitoring’ – inspecting the inputs and outputs of the
system to track performance and detect problems – and update their systems on an ongoing
basis. This process involves gathering and analysing user feedback, tracking performance metrics,
and making iterative improvements to address issues or limitations discovered during real-world
use (38). These improvements can include more fine-tuning or an updating of the system
integration. In practice, there is often a ‘cat-and-mouse game’ in which developers continually
update high-profile systems in response to newly discovered issues (39). See 3.4.2. Monitoring and
intervention, for a discussion of methods for monitoring general-purpose AI systems and
intervening where needed.
Since the publication of the Interim Report, developers have made significant advances in
system integration techniques that may enable general-purpose AI to perform more
advanced reasoning. In September 2024, OpenAI announced its new o1 prototype model with
more advanced scaffolding and training methods that have enabled significant performance
gains on tasks such as mathematics and programming (2*). Unlike previous models, o1
employs ‘chain of thought’ problem-solving that breaks problems down into steps which are
then solved bit-by-bit. Chain of thought has enabled improvements in complex tasks – o1
scored 83% on International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) qualifying exams compared to
GPT-4o's 13% – and is considered an important step towards developing AI agents:
general-purpose AI systems that can autonomously interact with the world, plan ahead, and
pursue goals. However, the improved problem-solving process requires significantly more
time and compute both during training and at point of use. The extent of the reasoning
capabilities of the model remains unclear (40).
There are various challenges for policymakers stemming from how general-purpose AI is
developed. Risks and vulnerabilities can emerge at many points along the development and
deployment process, making the most effective interventions difficult to pinpoint and
prioritise. Advances in model development are also happening rapidly and are difficult to
predict. This makes it difficult to articulate robust policy interventions that will age well with a
rapidly evolving technology. Not only are the risks and vulnerabilities associated with
general-purpose AI likely to change, the demands of model development are, too. For
example, reasoning-based models such as o1 demand much greater computational resources
at point of use, which presents new implications for long-term compute infrastructure
planning. 1.2. Current capabilities and 1.3. Capabilities in coming years expand on the state of
current AI capabilities and the ways in which those capabilities are likely to evolve, posing new
risks and challenges.

KEY INFORMATION†


● Understanding and measuring the capabilities of general-purpose AI is crucial for
assessing their risks. Existing governance frameworks and commitments rely on precisely
measuring general-purpose AI capabilities, but they are a moving target and difficult to
measure and define.
● Most experts agree that general-purpose AI systems are capable of tasks including:
○ Assisting programmers and performing small- to medium-sized software engineering
tasks.
○ Creating images that are hard to distinguish from real photographs.
○ Engaging in fluent conversation in many languages.
○ Finding and summarising information relevant to a question or problem from many data
sources.
○ Working simultaneously with multiple ‘modalities’ such as text, video, and speech.
○ Solving textbook mathematics and science problems at up to a graduate level.
● Most experts agree that general-purpose AI is currently not capable of tasks including:
○ Performing useful robotic tasks such as household work.
○ Consistently avoiding false statements.
○ Independently executing long projects, such as multi-day programming or research
projects.
● General-purpose AI agents can increasingly act and plan autonomously by controlling
computers. Leading AI companies are making large investments in AI agents because they
are expected to be economically valuable. There is rapid progress on tests related to web
browsing, coding, and research tasks, though current AI agents still struggle with work that
requires many steps.
● Since the publication of the Interim Report (May 2024), general-purpose AI systems have
markedly improved at tests of scientific reasoning and programming. These improvements
come in part from techniques that let general-purpose AI break down complex problems
into smaller steps, by writing so-called ‘chains of thought’, before solving them.
● A key challenge for policymakers is how to account for context-specific capabilities in
regulations. The capabilities of general-purpose AI can significantly change with more
careful fine-tuning, prompting, and tools made available to the system. They can also
decline in unfamiliar contexts. More rigorous evaluations needed to avoid overestimating
or underestimating capabilities.

produce as output, including text (language or code), images, video, and robotic actions.
● Capabilities: The range of tasks or functions that an AI system can perform, and how
competently it can perform them.
● Inference-time enhancements: Techniques used to improve an AI system's performance
after its initial training, without changing the underlying model. This includes clever
prompting methods, answer selection methods (e.g. sampling multiple responses and
choosing a majority answer), writing long ‘chains of thought’, agent ‘scaffolding’, and more.
● Scaffold(ing): Additional software built around an AI system that helps it to perform a task.
For example, an AI system might be given access to an external calculator app to increase
its performance on arithmetical problems. More sophisticated scaffolding may structure a
model’s outputs and guide the model to improve its answers step-by-step.
● Chain of thought: A reasoning process in which an AI generates intermediate steps or
explanations while solving a problem or answering a question. This approach mimics human
logical reasoning and internal deliberation, helping the model break down complex tasks into
smaller, sequential steps to improve accuracy and transparency in its outputs.
● Inference: The process in which an AI generates outputs based on a given input, thereby
applying the knowledge learnt during training.
● AI agent: A general-purpose AI which can make plans to achieve goals, adaptively perform
tasks involving multiple steps and uncertain outcomes along the way, and interact with its
environment – for example by creating files, taking actions on the web, or delegating tasks
to other agents – with little to no human oversight.
● Evaluations: Systematic assessments of an AI system's performance, capabilities,
vulnerabilities or potential impacts. Evaluations can include benchmarking, red-teaming and
audits and can be conducted both before and after model deployment.
● Benchmark: A standardised, often quantitative test or metric used to evaluate and compare
the performance of AI systems on a fixed set of tasks designed to represent real-world
usage.
This section focuses on the core capabilities of general-purpose AI models and systems that are
publicly available today. Section 1.3. Capabilities in coming years, discusses expected future
developments in AI capabilities, and Section 2. Risks, discusses specific dangerous capabilities and
their associated applications that contribute to risks.
A general-purpose AI system’s capabilities are difficult to reliably measure (41). An important
caveat on assessments of AI capabilities is that their capability profiles, and the consistency with
which they exhibit certain capabilities, differ significantly from those of humans. For example, two
studies find that language models fail more often on counting and arithmetic problems involving
numbers that are rare in their training data (42*, 43). An AI system’s success on a test of
capabilities depends highly on the particular examples chosen for the test, as well as how it is

asked or instructed to solve them (which, in practice, depends on its user’s skill) – making it
particularly challenging to ensure the absence of a capability in an AI system (e.g. one that could
entail societal risks (44*)); see 2.1 Risks from malicious use. Diversity of data and appropriate
investment into methods to elicit the desired behaviour from a model (e.g. through inference-time
enhancements such as scaffolding, prompting, and fine-tuning) can help make capability
assessment more reliable.
Input and output modalities

The ‘modalities’ of an AI system are the kinds of data that it can usefully receive as input and
produce as output. For example, general-purpose AI systems with a text modality might take in
user-entered text or source documents, and produce coherent natural language, engage in
conversations, and answer reading comprehension questions about a passage. AI systems with
image and text modalities may be able to answer questions about the contents of images, or
generate images according to natural language instructions. Understanding the modalities which a
general-purpose AI system can process is important for developing an intuition about the broad
sets of tasks that it might be able to accomplish in theory, and the possible threats that it – and
future models of its kind – may pose. General-purpose systems exist for 9+ modalities (45)
including text, audio, images, and video, with some systems specifically focusing on an additional
modality such as robotic actions, representations of proteins and other molecules, time series data
(46*) or music (47*). However, text- and image-processing systems such as ChatGPT are the
source of much of the present attention on general-purpose AI. Advanced general-purpose AI
systems are increasingly able to process inputs and generate outputs in multiple modalities such
as text, video, and speech.
Text and code: General-purpose AI systems can engage in interactive dialogue and write short
computer programs. Advanced language models can generate text and engage in interactive
dialogue across a variety of natural languages, topics, and formats. Examples include OpenAI’s
GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini, as well as openly available models from Meta (the
Llama series of models), Mistral AI, Alibaba (the Qwen series), and DeepSeek (48*, 49*, 50*, 51*, 52*,
53*, 54*). In addition to human language, these models can process and generate many kinds of
data encoded as text, including mathematical formulae and computer code. They can write
short- to medium-length programmes, assist software developers, and perform computer actions
(such as web searches) when provided with affordances such as internet access (55, 56).
Audio and speech: General-purpose AI systems can engage in spoken conversation and
convincingly emulate humans’ voices. Some general-purpose AI systems, including GPT-4o (3*)
and Gemini 1.5 (49*), can process audio in much the same way as text, answering questions about
the contents of an audio clip (for example, a spoken conversation). One recent study on using
narrow AI for text-to-speech synthesis found that on two academic speech synthesis benchmarks,
a person’s voice could be convincingly replicated in high-quality audio from only a three-second

1.2 Current capabilities
40
recording (57*). The general-purpose AI system GPT-4o can converse in real time with human-like
speech in its ‘advanced voice mode’ and can emulate a variety of human voices.
Images: General-purpose AI systems can describe the contents of images with high accuracy,
generate images according to a detailed description, and perform other image-based tasks. Many
general-purpose AI systems can use images as both input and output. General-purpose AI systems
such as Claude, and GPT-4o, Pixtral, and Qwen2-VL can describe the contents of images in
language, including objects and activities depicted therein (3*, 50*, 58*, 59*, 60*). The most
capable models can make sense of complex images and documents, with Anthropic reporting that
its Claude 3.5 Sonnet system can correctly answer over 90% of questions in three benchmarks that
involve processing documents, charts and science diagrams, representing human standardised
testing settings (5*). General-purpose AI systems can also generate images as output, with
contents and style specified in human language (for example, systems such as Stable Diffusion 3
(15*) and DALL-E 3 (14*)). Advances in image-generation models make it easier to control their
images’ content and style, depict increasingly complex and realistic scenes, and produce images
which are close to indistinguishable from natural ones (14*). Other general-purpose AI systems can
perform image-based tasks such as categorising the objects depicted within images (61) and
identifying their locations (62*).
Video: General-purpose AI systems can transcribe or describe the contents of videos, and
generate short videos according to instructions, but the movement depicted in these videos is not
always realistic. Some general-purpose AI systems can take video as input and analyse its
contents, such as V-JEPA (63*), Gemini 1.5 (49*), GPT-4o (3*), and Qwen2-VL (60*). These systems
can enable searching and analysing long-form content, for example locating key moments or pieces
of information revealed in a video. Some general-purpose systems can also generate realistic,
high-definition video, for example Sora (16*) and Movie Gen (64*). These models can generate short
(less than one minute) videos depicting a scene described in text, optionally with reference to
other images and videos as well. They can modify videos according to instructions (e.g. changing
the depicted season from summer to winter) and generate videos depicting individuals in reference
photographs (e.g. performing a described activity). These videos generally look realistic, though the
accuracy of the generated scenes to the instructional text tends to be worse than for
state-of-the-art image generation systems, and the videos often contain unnatural or physically
impossible movements which clearly distinguish them from natural video. Advanced video models
have only reached the market in 2024 and their implications are still being explored.
Robotic actions: General-purpose AI systems can be used to plan out robotic movements, but
cannot yet themselves control physical robots or machines. General-purpose AI systems can be
used for planning multi-step robot actions and translating instructional language into robotic action
plans (65*, 66). Researchers are also exploring general-purpose AI models that not only plan or
interpret, but also generate robotic actions, such as Google's RT-2-X (67), and the autonomous
driving company Waymo is developing general-purpose AI models for generating driving plans and
models of a vehicle’s environment (68*). However, general-purpose AI models’ abilities to generate 
Capabilities of general-purpose AI
1.2 Current capabilities
41
robotic actions are relatively rudimentary. Part of the reason is that data collection for actions
generally requires running physical robots and is challenging to do at very large scale (69), although
substantial efforts are being made (67, 70, 71). General-purpose AI systems cannot yet effectively
control physical robots or machines to perform many useful tasks such as household work, as the
integration of general-purpose AI models with motor control systems remains a challenge (72).
Proteins and other molecules: General-purpose AI systems can perform a range of tasks useful to
biologists, such as predicting protein folding and aiding protein design. General-purpose AI
systems that work with proteins and other large molecules operate using various representations
(e.g. residue sequences, 3D structures). These models can predict protein structures under various
conditions (e.g. in protein–protein complexes), generate useful novel proteins, and perform a wide
range of protein-related tasks relevant to drug discovery and design (73*), qualifying them as
‘foundation models’ (74) and as general-purpose AI models under this report’s definition (see
Introduction). They can increasingly be used to generate designs of new proteins with predictable
functions across large protein families (75, 76).
Enhancements after pre-training

The tasks that a general-purpose AI system can accomplish depend on the techniques applied to it
after initial pre-training. A review of 16 enhancement methods found that they generally require less
than 1% of the computational resources to implement than was used for pre-training the systems,
while improving those systems’ capabilities approximately as much as would be expected from
devoting 5x more resources to pre-training (77). This suggests that policy around the development
and deployment of general-purpose AI systems may need to anticipate the effect that these
enhancements will have on general-purpose AI systems’ capabilities. Some common enhancement
methods (77, 78) include:
● Fine-tuning: Fine-tuning refers to further training the pre-trained base model to optimise it
for a specific application or make it more useful generally, for instance by training it to follow
instructions.
● Inference-time enhancements: Inference is the process in which an AI model generates
outputs based on a given input, thereby applying the knowledge learnt during training.
Inference-time enhancements are a class of system integration techniques that modify a
model’s inputs and organise its outputs. Examples include producing multiple candidate
answers to a question and selecting the best among them (79*, 80*), producing long ‘chains
of thought’ (see next paragraph) to work through complex problems (2*), or using hybrids of
these approaches (81). Other inference-time enhancements include:
○ Prompting methods: crafting the system’s instructions to improve its performance,
for example by providing it with example problems and solutions (82, 83), providing
useful documents for context, or instructing it to ‘think step-by-step’ (84);
○ Agent scaffolding and tool use: providing the model with means to break down a
high-level task into a plan with clear subgoals and delegate to copies of itself to

perform each step of the plan, interacting with its environment, e.g. using websites
(85*) or running code (86*, 87, 88*) to carry out its work as an AI agent (89, 90).

Figure 1.3: Since the publication of the Interim Report (May 2024), general-purpose AI models have seen rapid
performance increases in answering PhD-level science questions. Researchers have been testing models on GPQA
Diamond, a collection of challenging multiple-choice questions about biology, chemistry, and physics, which people
without PhD-level expertise in each area are unable to correctly answer even with access to the internet. On these tests,
accuracy rose from 33% with GPT-4 in June 2023 (slightly above random guessing) to 49% with GPT-4o in May 2024,
reaching 70% (matching experts with a PhD in the area of each question) with o1-preview in September 2024. This
increase is partly due to o1-preview writing a long ‘chain of thought’ in which it can break down the problem and try
different approaches before producing its final answer. For progress on other tests, see Figure 1.4 in 1.3. Capabilities in
coming years. Source: Epoch AI, 2024 (91).
Since the publication of the Interim Report, studies have shown a general-purpose AI
system’s capabilities can be significantly increased by having it devote more time and
computation to each individual problem. OpenAI’s o1 system, released in September of 2024,
achieved a high enough score on the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME)
to qualify for the USA Mathematical Olympiad, and reached expert PhD-level performance on
postgraduate-level physics, chemistry, and biology questions curated for high difficulty (92*)
(see Figure 1.3). The key to o1’s improvements was to leverage extra computation at inference
time by writing a long ‘chain of thought’ to break down the problem and work through
hypotheses. Another popular inference-time enhancement leverages increased computation
during inference-time by sampling multiple outputs from the model and choosing among
them. Two recent studies by industry, academic and civil society researchers investigate how

capabilities scale with the amount of inference-time computation using such techniques (93,
94*). They found that capabilities increase at a rate which is approximately logarithmic with
inference-time computation investment, forming a similar trend to the relationship between
capability growth and training time computation as described in Section 1.3. Capabilities in
coming years. This, together with o1’s success, suggests that the amount of inference-time
computation devoted to each problem might be a general-purpose lever by which the
capabilities of an existing general-purpose AI system may be increased (especially in science
and technology applications), i.e. by simply allowing it to produce a much longer ‘chain of
thought’ before its answer. However, eliciting improved capabilities using more inference-time
computation requires more computation, increasing costs.
What can current general-purpose AI do?

General-purpose language models can correctly answer many common-sense and factual
questions, but they can be inconsistent and make trivial errors. General-purpose AI systems
encode an extensive range of facts, with current state-of-the-art systems scoring on average
above 92% in undergraduate-level tests of knowledge in subjects such as chemistry and law (92*).
However, these systems often fail to identify subtle factual distinctions or self-contradictory
arguments (95, 96), are prone to provide biased answers on the basis of user interaction patterns
(97, 98), are less accurate at answering questions about unusual scenarios (42*, 99*, 100), and
commonly generate completely non-existent or false citations, biographies, or facts (101, 102*, 103,
104, 105), or make simple common-sense errors (106, 107). These issues are taken by some
researchers to indicate that they lack a true understanding of how the world works (108) and make
it difficult to adopt such systems in settings that require high reliability. See 1.3. Capabilities in
coming years for further discussion.
General-purpose AI systems can achieve performance similar to or better than human experts on
some self-contained knowledge and reasoning tasks, but they still make mistakes on easy
problems in ways that humans do not. In one study, a general-purpose AI system was able to
predict the probability of future events with accuracy rivalling that of expert forecasters on an
online forecasting platform (109). With respect to coding, o1 performs at the 89th percentile of
humans on Codeforces, an online competitive coding platform, and can resolve 41% of a sample of
self-contained, real-world engineering tasks drawn from the code-sharing platform GitHub (2*).
However, even on simple primary school mathematical word problems, general-purpose AI systems
exhibit error patterns that are distinct from those of humans. For example, two studies find that
their accuracy greatly decreases when obviously irrelevant sentences are inserted into the problem
(110*, 111*), with a 17.5% reduction in accuracy for a preview version of o1 (110*). Two recent studies
also find that as general-purpose AI systems are given problems that require more steps of
reasoning to solve, their error rate increases faster than one would expect if they had a constant
error rate per step (110*, 112*). This suggests that general-purpose AI systems cannot be relied upon
for complex problems, and leads some researchers to claim that these systems ‘cannot perform
genuine logical reasoning’ (110*), although opinions on this among experts are mixed.

Studies show that AI assistance makes software developers more productive, and adoption of AI
tools for programming is increasing. Studies on GitHub Copilot, a popular early AI coding aid, show
productivity boosts of anywhere from 8–22% (113) to 56% (114*). Developers perceive themselves
as being more productive when surveyed (115), and AI assistance is generally more beneficial for
inexperienced developers (114*, 115). In a survey of over 65,000 software developers from
May–June 2024 by Stack Overflow, a popular programming Q&A community forum, 63% of
professional software developers reported using AI tools in their workflow (116), up from 44% the
previous year (117).
Since the publication of the Interim Report, general-purpose AI agents which independently
perform tasks on the computer have been subject to heavy investment and are rapidly
becoming more reliable on benchmarks designed to test labour automation potential. AI
agents are general-purpose AI systems that can autonomously make plans, perform complex
tasks, and interact with their environment by controlling software and computers, with little
human oversight. AI agents can be created by equipping general-purpose AI systems with a
thin layer of additional software known as ‘scaffolding’. Example tasks for AI agents include
web browsing tasks such as answering questions (85*) or online shopping (118, 119), assistance
with scientific research (22*, 120, 121*), software development (122), training machine learning
models (123*, 124, 125*, 126), carrying out cyberattacks (127), following instructions to navigate
simulated environments (128), or controlling physical robots (19*). On most of these tasks,
current AI agents succeed in cases of low to medium complexity, but fail when the task
requires many steps or becomes more complex. In an evaluation study on 77 tasks, ranging
from simple tasks such as exploiting basic website vulnerabilities to complex, multi-step tasks
such as training machine learning models, state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o, o1, and
Claude 3.5 Sonnet succeeded at nearly 40% of tasks when equipped with agent scaffolding, a
similar rate to humans who are limited to 30 minutes for each task (2*, 129). In the same
study, o1 made some progress – not fully succeeding – on two out of seven difficult tasks
designed to reflect challenging tasks in AI research and development (R&D), such as
optimising neural network code (2*, 129). Progress in this area is rapid: new agent
architectures are rapidly being developed (130*, 131*, 132*), and the top system’s success rate
on a high-quality subset of SWE-bench, a popular software engineering agent benchmark,
increased from 22% to 45% from April to August 2024 (122).
Since the publication of the Interim Report, researchers have also made progress in leveraging
new kinds of multimodal data to train AI models for robot control. One approach involves
training a system on a large dataset of videos annotated with text descriptions of their
contents, followed by a smaller dataset of (scarce) videos annotated with robot action
commands (133*). A second new approach uses existing vision-enabled general-purpose AI
to translate videos of humans into action plans for robots, and trains robot control models
using this data (134). A third new approach trains on video alone but involves models implicitly
learning the actions depicted in it, allowing the model to quickly adapt to controlling new
robots, even if its initial training was only on videos of humans (135*). These studies suggest 
Capabilities of general-purpose AI
1.2 Current capabilities
45
that new methods leveraging multimodal learning will soon open up the data bottleneck that
currently prevents developers from training general-purpose AI systems to control robots.
The main evidence gaps around current AI capabilities include:
● There is no consistently up-to-date comprehensive index of AI capabilities. Evidence on
AI capabilities quickly becomes outdated as new models are released and inference-time
enhancements are developed. Researchers’ understanding of AI capabilities advances
through a relatively ad hoc patchwork of academic and industry publications which can be
challenging to synthesise into a comprehensive picture. Policymakers would ideally have
access to evidence which is up to date, reliable, standardised and comprehensive.
● Evaluations of AI capabilities often do not replicate on new data. Evaluation studies
provide examples of an AI system performing a task (or failing to do so) on some sample
data, but they often do not replicate when the experiments are rerun or tried on different
data (136). For evaluations to be reliable and replicable, they should ideally be run on large,
diverse datasets which are expanded over time.
● There are no common standards for measuring how AI augments human capabilities.
There are not yet standardised benchmarks for ‘uplift’ – measuring how effectively
humans can use general-purpose AI systems to accomplish various tasks, compared to
using existing technology – which can inform the public of this aspect of progress. (Such
tests are undertaken – though the details are often confidential – for chemical, biological,
radiological and nuclear (CBRN) misuse risks; see 2.1.4. Biological and chemical attacks and
2.4 Impact of open-weight general-purpose AI models on AI risks.)
For policymakers, key challenges include:
● Standardised measures of capabilities, such as multiple-choice benchmark tests, may not
measure the capabilities of AI systems in the contexts that are most relevant to their risks
(e.g. when used as an aid by humans).
● After initial development, AI models can be continually improved upon through fine-tuning
and inference-time enhancements. These improvements will increase the contextual
capabilities and potentially affect the risks of models that are already available to the
public, and the changes would be outside the scope of tests by developers of the base
model. It will be difficult to design policy robust to this kind of continuous change.

KEY INFORMATION†

● In the coming months and years, the capabilities of general-purpose AI systems could
advance slowly, rapidly, or extremely rapidly. Both expert opinions and available evidence
support each of these trajectories. To make timely decisions, policymakers will need to
account for these scenarios and their associated risks. A key question is how rapidly AI
developers can scale up existing approaches using even more compute and data, and
whether this would be sufficient to overcome the limitations of current systems, such as
their unreliability in executing lengthy tasks.
● Developers of general-purpose AI are advancing scientific, engineering, and ‘agent’
capabilities. In recent months, models have substantially improved at tests of scientific
reasoning and programming, enabling new applications. Additionally, AI developers are
making large efforts to develop more reliable general-purpose AI agents that can execute
longer tasks or projects without human oversight by using computers and software tools,
potentially with continuous learning during operation.
● General-purpose AI-based tools are increasingly being used to accelerate the
development of software and hardware, including general-purpose AI itself. They are
widely used to more efficiently write software to train and deploy AI, to aid in designing AI
chips, and to generate and curate training data. How this will affect the pace of progress
has received little study.
● Recent improvements have been primarily driven by scaling up the compute and data
used for pre-training, and by refining existing algorithmic approaches. For cutting-edge
models, current estimates suggest that these factors have, in recent years, approximately
increased:
○ Compute for pre-training: 4x/year
○ Pre-training dataset size: 2.5x/year
○ Energy used for powering computer chips during training: 3x/year
○ Algorithmic pre-training efficiency: 3x/year (higher uncertainty)
○ Hardware efficiency: 1.3x/year
● It is likely feasible for AI developers to continue to exponentially increase resources used
for training, but this is not guaranteed. If recent trends continue, by the end of 2026, AI
developers will train models using roughly 100x more training compute than 2023's most
compute-intensive models, growing to 10,000x more training compute by 2030. New
research suggests that this degree of scaling is likely feasible, depending on investment
and policy decisions. However, it is more likely that today’s pace of scaling will become
infeasible after the 2020s due to bottlenecks in data, chip production, financial capital,
and local energy supply.

● Researchers debate the effectiveness of scaling up resources for training with current
algorithmic techniques. Some experts are sceptical as to whether scaling up training
resources would be sufficient to overcome the limitations of current systems, while others
expect that it will continue to be the key ingredient for further advances.
● AI developers have recently adopted a potentially more effective additional scaling
approach. Models can be trained to write longer so-called 'chains of thought' to break
down problems into steps before generating responses, allowing compute scaling during
runtime rather than training. This method has shown promise in overcoming various
limitations in tests of scientific reasoning and programming and may provide an additional
path if traditional training scaling yields diminishing returns.
● Since the publication of the Interim Report (May 2024), general-purpose AI systems have
become more affordable to use, more practically useful, and more widely adopted.
Developers have also significantly enhanced models' performance at tests of
mathematical and scientific reasoning (see 1.2. Current capabilities).
● Policymakers face challenges in monitoring and responding to AI progress. Key challenges
include quantitatively tracking AI advancements and their primary drivers, as well as
designing adaptive risk management frameworks that activate mitigations only when
capabilities (and associated risks) increase.
Key Definitions
● Scaling laws: Systematic relationships observed between an AI model’s size (or the amount
of time, data or computational resources used in training or inference) and its performance.
● Compute: Shorthand for ‘computational resources’, which refers to the hardware (e.g. GPUs),
software (e.g. data management software) and infrastructure (e.g. data centres) required to
train and run AI systems.
● Algorithmic (training) efficiency: A set of measures of how efficiently an algorithm uses
computational resources to learn from data, such as the amount of memory used or the
time taken for training.
● AI agent: A general-purpose AI which can make plans to achieve goals, adaptively perform
tasks involving multiple steps and uncertain outcomes along the way, and interact with its
environment – for example by creating files, taking actions on the web, or delegating tasks
to other agents – with little to no human oversight.
● Inference: The process in which an AI generates outputs based on a given input, thereby
applying the knowledge learnt during training.
● Chain of thought: A reasoning process in which an AI generates intermediate steps or
explanations while solving a problem or answering a question. This approach mimics human
logical reasoning and internal deliberation, helping the model break down complex tasks into
smaller, sequential steps to improve accuracy and transparency in its outputs.
● Benchmark: A standardised, often quantitative test or metric used to evaluate and compare
the performance of AI systems on a fixed set of tasks designed to represent real-world
usage.

● Emergent behaviour: The ability of AI systems to act in ways that were not explicitly
programmed or intended by their developers or users.
● Cognitive tasks: Activities that involve processing information, problem-solving,
decision-making, and creative thinking. Examples include research, writing, and
programming.
● Synthetic data: Data like text or images that has been artificially generated, for instance by
general-purpose AI systems. Synthetic data might be used for training AI systems, e.g. when
high-quality natural data is scarce.
● Modalities: The kinds of data that an AI system can competently receive as input and
produce as output, including text (language or code), images, video, and robotic actions.
1.3.1. Recent trends in general-purpose AI capabilities
The pace of recent general-purpose AI progress has been rapid, often surpassing the expectations
of AI experts on widely used metrics. Researchers assess AI performance using ‘benchmarks’ –
standardised sets of problems designed to compare AI systems’ performance within one or
multiple domains. Over the last decade, general-purpose AI systems and earlier AI systems have
achieved or exceeded human-level performance on benchmarks across a wide variety of domains,
such as natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, and mathematics (see
Figure 1.4). For example, consider the MATH benchmark (137), which tests mathematical
problem-solving skills via a series of word problems. These problems range in difficulty from simple
primary school-level questions to problems that challenge international mathematics competition
winners. When this benchmark was released in 2021, general-purpose AI systems scored around
5%, but three years later, the model o1 reached 94.8% (92*), matching the score of expert human
testers (in this case, a gold medallist in the IMO). However, it is often unclear how impressive
performance on benchmarks translates into performance in real-world tasks, as discussed below
(138).
AI systems have become much more cost efficient to run, with the prices for running AI systems at
a given capability level falling by multiple orders of magnitude. For example, in 2022 it cost users
~$25 to generate a million words using GPT-3, but by 2023 this fell to almost $1 using the
performance-equivalent Llama 2 7B (see Figure 1.5). These price decreases partly stem from
technological advancements, such as hardware improvements that allow more computation to be
performed at the same price (144). Price drops can also occur due to decreases in the price
markups companies charge, and the measured decrease also depends on the chosen benchmark
and level of performance.

Figure 1.4: Performance of AI models on various benchmarks has advanced rapidly between 1998 to 2024. Note that
some earlier results used machine learning AI models that are not general-purpose models. On some recent benchmarks,
models progressed within a short period of time from having poor performance to surpassing the performance of human
subjects who are often experts. Note that early results in this graph used machine learning AI models that are not
general-purpose models. Sources: Kiela et al., 2021 (139) (for MNIST, Switchboard, ImageNet, SQuAD 1.1, 2 and GLUE). Data
for MMLU, Big Bench, GPQA are from the relevant papers (3*, 5*, 92*, 140, 141, 142, 143*).
Since the publication of the Interim Report, research on improving general-purpose AI
capabilities has begun to focus on new directions, while efforts to scale up training resources
continue. For example, one direction is improving the autonomy of general-purpose AI
systems – producing AI agents that act and plan in pursuit of goals (150) (see 1.2. Current
capabilities, and 3.2.1. Technical challenges for risk management and policymaking). Another
direction involves using multiple copies of models together to accomplish new tasks (151*).

Figure 1.5: This graph shows how general-purpose language models have become markedly more cost efficient to use,
measured by the number of words generated per dollar while maintaining a given performance level on the MMLU
benchmark. The version of GPT-3 175B released after September 2022 and Llama 2 7B both achieve a score of around
44% accuracy (48*, 145*), whereas Mistral Large and GPT-4o mini achieve around 82% (12*, 146*). The original GPT-4
from March 2023 and the recently released o1-mini both score around 86% on MMLU (92*, 147*). Note that this graph is
primarily for illustrative purposes, since reported prices and MMLU performance depend on evaluation methods.
Furthermore, o1-mini writes so-called ‘chains of thought’ that users cannot access before producing a final answer, so in
practice the number of accessible words generated per dollar is likely lower than depicted in the figure. Sources: Chung
et al., 2022 (145*) and Touvron et al., 2023 (48*) (for GPT-3 175B and Llama 2 7B); Mistral AI, 2024 (12*) and OpenAI,
2024f (146*) (for Mistral Large and GPT-4o mini); Open AI, 2024g (92*) and OpenAI et al., 2024 (147*) (for GPT-4 and
o1-mini); OpenAI, 2024d (148*) and Together Pricing, 2023 (149*) (for pricing data).
New evidence suggests that scaling training compute and data at current rates is technically
feasible until at least ca. 2030. Over the last decade, training compute for cutting-edge
models has increased an estimated 4x per year. If this trend continues, systems will be trained
with roughly 100x more compute than GPT-4 by the end of 2026, growing to around 10,000x
by the end of the decade (152). However, it is unclear how this translates into improved
capabilities, and whether the economic returns are large enough to justify the expense of
such massive degrees of scaling.

1.3.2. Can the limitations of current systems be resolved
through scaling, refining, and combining existing
approaches?
Current general-purpose AI systems have an uneven set of capabilities, and
still have many limitations

Humans and general-purpose AI systems have distinct strengths and weaknesses, making
comparisons challenging. It is tempting to compare the cognitive abilities of humans and AI
systems, for instance because this informs which economic tasks might be especially strongly
impacted by AI use. However, current general-purpose AI systems often demonstrate uneven
performance, excelling in some domains while struggling in others (153), which makes overly general
comparisons less meaningful. While general-purpose AI now outperforms humans on some
benchmarks, some scientists argue that it still lacks the deep conceptual understanding and
abstract reasoning capabilities of humans (153). General-purpose AI systems can replace humans
in some activities, whereas in others, the distinct strengths and weaknesses of AI systems and
humans combine to produce fruitful collaborations (see 2.3.1. Labour market risks).
Current general-purpose AI systems are prone to some failures that humans are not (154, 155).
Some works suggest that general-purpose AI reasoning can struggle to cope with novel scenarios
and is overly influenced by superficial similarities (110*, 153). General-purpose AI systems have also
been shown to sometimes fail at reasoning on seemingly simple tasks. For instance, a model trained
on data including the statement ‘Olaf Scholz was the ninth Chancellor of Germany’ will not always
be able to answer the question ‘Who was the ninth Chancellor of Germany?’ (154). In addition, there
is evidence that general-purpose AI systems can be caused to deviate from their usual safeguards
by nonsensical input, while humans would recognise these prompts (see 3.4.1. Training more
trustworthy models). Limitations of current systems are further discussed in 1.2. Current
capabilities.
Existing AI training approaches will likely extend model capabilities, but the
degree of improvement and its real-world significance are heavily debated
Evidence suggests that further resource scaling will increase overall AI capabilities.
Researchers have discovered empirical ‘scaling laws’ (see Figure 1.6), which are mathematical
relationships that quantify the relationship between inputs of the AI training process (such as
amounts of data and compute) and the capabilities of the model on broad performance tasks
such as next-word prediction (156*, 157*). These studies demonstrate that AI models’
performance tends to improve with increased computational resources across a range of
domains, including computer vision (158*, 159), language modelling (156*, 157*), and game 
Capabilities of general-purpose AI
1.3 Capabilities in coming years
52
playing (160*). Although many performance measures do not directly test real-world
capabilities, general-purpose AI model performance has been observed to consistently
improve on broad benchmarks that test many capabilities, such as MMLU (140), as the models
are scaled up.
Figure 1.6: Performance (as measured by ‘training loss’) improves predictably as AI developers use more compute for
training (lower ‘training loss’ means better performance) (157*). In this experiment, additional compute was allocated to
training larger language models (more parameters, indicated by colour) on more data. FLOP (floating point operations)
refers to the number of computational operations performed during training. Each line shows how performance (as
measured by a lower ‘training loss’, which is a proxy measure for capabilities) improves as training FLOP increases for a
model of a given size. Source: Hoffmann et al., 2022 (157*).
However, it is unclear whether further resource scaling will improve AI capabilities at the same rate
as in the last decade. Scaling laws have proven robust, holding across a range of million-fold to
billion-fold increases in training computation. However, these scaling laws have thus far been
derived from empirical observations, not from inviolable principles (although theoretical models
have been proposed to explain them) (161*, 162*, 163, 164, 165). Furthermore, some scaling laws are
derived from limited data, which makes them less reliable (41, 166*, 167, 168*, 169, 170*). As a result,
there is no mathematical guarantee that scaling laws will continue to hold at larger scales, beyond
the range of the empirical data used to establish them. On the other hand, a breakdown of the main
scaling laws has not been scientifically established either, despite ongoing news reports.
While aggregate AI capabilities improve predictably with scale, it is difficult to predict when
specific capabilities will appear. There are many documented examples of capabilities that appear
when models reach a certain scale, sometimes suddenly, without being explicitly programmed into
the model (170*, 171, 172, 173*, 174, 175). For example, LLMs at a certain scale have gained the ability
to accurately add large numbers, when prompted to perform the calculation step-by-step. Some
researchers define these as ‘emergent’ capabilities (171, 172, 173*, 174), indicating that they are

present in larger models but not in smaller models and so their emergence is often hard to predict
in advance. On the other hand, recent research has made some progress in predicting ‘emergent’
capabilities (176, 177). There is ongoing debate about whether capabilities can be called ‘emergent’:
some definitions of emergence require that the capability appears suddenly or unpredictably at a
certain scale (which is not always the case), whereas other definitions only require that the
capability appears as models are scaled, without being explicitly designed to have the capability.
It is debated to what extent benchmark performance reflects real-world understanding or utility. AI
models have made rapid progress on many benchmark metrics, but these benchmarks are limited
compared to real-world tasks, and experts debate whether these metrics effectively evaluate truly
general capabilities (178, 179*). State-of-the-art general-purpose AI models often exhibit
unexpected weaknesses or a lack of robustness on some benchmarks. For example, these systems
perform worse on rare or more difficult variants of tasks that are not seen in the training data (40,
110*). Some researchers hypothesise that this is because the systems partly or fully rely on
memorising patterns rather than employing robust reasoning or abstract thinking (153, 180*). In
some cases, models were trained on the benchmark solutions, leading to high benchmark
performance despite the models not being able to perform well on the task in real-world contexts
(181, 182). Models also struggle to adapt to cultures that are less represented in the training data
(183). Issues like these underscore the difficulty of assessing what benchmark results imply about
models’ capacity to reliably apply knowledge to practical, real-world scenarios.
However, sometimes general-purpose AI systems perform well on difficult tasks designed to test
reasoning, without having had a chance to memorise the solutions. In general, the presence of
memorisation found in some studies does not imply the absence of more advanced processes like
reasoning – it is possible for both to exist in different models or within the same model. There is
evidence (184*, 185) that some AI models have generalised their learning to situations that they
have not been trained on, suggesting that they are not only memorising data. Some
general-purpose language models (and systems built with them) have performed well on reasoning
and mathematics problems whose solutions were not part of their training data (186*). This extends
to reaching medal-level performance at the recent International Olympiads for mathematics (187*,
188) and computer science (92*) and the challenging Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC,
(189)).
There is substantial disagreement about whether AI developers can achieve broadly human-level AI
on most cognitive tasks by scaling training resources as well as refining and combining existing
techniques. Some argue that continued scaling (potentially combined with refining and combining
existing approaches) could lead to the development of general-purpose AI systems that perform at
a broadly human level or beyond for most cognitive tasks (190). This view draws support from the
observation of consistent scaling laws and how increased scale has overcome many limitations of
early language models such as GPT-1, which could rarely generate a coherent paragraph of text.
Others contend that deep learning has fundamental limitations which cannot be solved through
scaling alone. These critics argue current systems rely on memorisation (at least partially, see 
Capabilities of general-purpose AI
1.3 Capabilities in coming years
54
above), and lack true common sense reasoning (153, 191, 192), causal reasoning (193), or an
understanding of the physical world (153, 191, 193), alongside other limitations discussed in 1.2.
Current capabilities. Addressing current limitations, they argue, may require significant conceptual
breakthroughs and innovations beyond the current paradigm of deep learning and scaling. However,
with the discovery of o1 (2*), researchers have recently identified a potentially more effective
scaling method that could overcome previous limitations or serve as an alternative if the returns
from traditional scaling diminish significantly (see 1.2. Current capabilities).
1.3.3. How much scaling and refinement of existing
approaches is expected in coming years?
Computing resources dedicated to training AI have been rapidly scaled up,
and further rapid scaling until 2030 appears feasible

AI developers have increased training compute for flagship models quickly, with growth at ~4x/year.
Training compute usage has grown exponentially since the early 2010s (see Figure 1.7), with the
average amount used to train machine learning models doubling approximately every six months
(26). For illustration, notable machine learning models (194, 195, 196) in 2010 were trained with
around ten billion times less compute than the largest models in 2023 (197, 198*).
AI companies have also invested more computational resources in deployment. This is both
because more general-purpose AI systems have been deployed to serve users (199), and because
deployed systems have access to more computational resources to increase capabilities. Models
can be run for longer, or the results of multiple models can be aggregated, resulting in performance
gains that complement the gains from using more training compute (80*, 92*, 93, 94*, 200*, 201,
202*, 203*, 204). For example, some estimates indicate that OpenAI incurred $700k/day in
deployment costs in 2023 (205), and that running AI represented 60% of Google’s CO2 emissions
from machine learning infrastructure as of 2022 (206).

The amount of training compute available has been growing, mostly due to large capital
expenditures increasing the quantity of AI chips. Since 2010, computing hardware has become
cheaper due to hardware improvements, meaning that the amount of computing power (compute)
that AI companies can buy with a dollar is increasing at a rate of 1.35x per year (144, 207). However,
the total compute used in training notable AI systems has increased by approximately 4x per year
since 2010 (26), outpacing the rate of hardware efficiency improvements. This suggests that the
primary driver of training compute growth has been investments to expand the AI chip stock, not
improvements in chip performance.
AI computation has massive energy demands, but current growth rates in AI power consumption
could persist for several years. Global AI computation is projected to require electricity

consumption similar to that of Austria or Finland by 2026 (208) (see 2.3.4. Risks to the environment
for more information). Based on current growth rates in power consumption for AI training, the
largest AI training runs in 2030 will need 1–5 gigawatts (GW) of power. Indeed, a compute provider
recently purchased a data centre with a 960-megawatt power supply (209). Thus, depending on
investment and policy decisions, energy bottlenecks likely will not prevent compute from scaling at
current rates until the end of the decade.
Figure 1.7: AI developers have consistently used more compute to train notable machine learning models over time, at an
increasing pace since 2010 (26, 197). Computation is measured in total FLOP (floating point operations) estimated from
AI literature — this refers to the number of computational operations performed during training. Estimates are expected
to be accurate within a factor of two, or a factor of five for recent undisclosed models such as GPT-4. Sources: Epoch AI,
2024 (26, 197); Sevilla et al., 2022 (26, 197).
Challenges to producing and improving AI chips exist, but can likely be overcome. It typically takes
3–5 years to build a computer chip fabrication plant (210, 211), and supply chain shortages
sometimes delay the production of important chip components (212, 213, 214). However, major AI
companies can still sustain compute growth in the near term by capturing large fractions of the AI
chip stock. For example, one study estimates that the share of the world’s data centre AI chips
owned by a single AI company at any point in time is somewhere between 10% and 40% (215).
Moreover, an analysis of existing trends and technical possibilities in chip production suggest that it
is possible to train AI systems with 100,000x more training compute than GPT-4 (the leading
language model of 2023) by 2030. This is sufficient to support existing growth rates in training
compute, which imply a total increase of 10,000x over the same period (215). Hence, chip

production constraints are significant, but they are unlikely to prevent further scaling of the largest
models at current rates until 2030 if investment is sustained (see Figure 1.8).

Figure 1.8: Four physical constraints to training general-purpose AI models using more compute by 2030. There are many
orders of magnitude of uncertainty in the overall estimates, but training runs using 10,000x more computation than
GPT-4 (released in 2023), which is in line with the existing trend, appear technically feasible based on these estimates.
Source: Sevilla et al. 2024 (215).
Training AI systems across a very large number of AI chips is difficult, which may prevent extremely
large training runs. For example, some estimates suggest that training runs that are 10,000 to 10
million times larger than GPT-4’s will be impossible due to constraints on how much information
can be moved between chips, and limits on the time to process data (215, 216). If these estimates
are correct, then these bottlenecks will limit the ability of AI developers to increase training
compute at existing rates over the next decade. However, it is possible that novel techniques or
simple workarounds will permit much larger training runs.

There is likely enough pre-training data for scaling until 2030, but projections
are highly uncertain after this point
Data shortages are a plausible bottleneck to continued scaling of language model pre-training.
Since 2010, data requirements for pre-training general-purpose AI systems have grown around 10x
every three years (197). For example, a state-of-the-art model in 2017 was trained with a few billion
words, whereas state-of-the-art general-purpose models in 2023 were trained with several trillion
(217*, 218*). A lot of this growth has been possible due to internet data availability, but growth rates

in the demand for data appear rapid enough to exhaust human-generated internet text data by
2030 (219, 220). These challenges are exacerbated by data copyright issues, as it may become
illegal for AI companies to train AI on certain types of data (see 2.3.6. Risks of copyright
infringement).
The degree of data scarcity is specific to the domain and actor. In some domains data gathering
can be substantially scaled up, such as in general-purpose robotics, where systems gather data
during deployment (221*).
Sourcing data from different modalities could help sustain data scaling. General-purpose AI
systems are increasingly being trained on multimodal data, combining textual, visual, auditory, or
biological information (59*, 222, 223, 224*). Several studies suggest that this will increase the
amount of training data available for models and endow models with novel capabilities, such as the
ability to analyse documents with both text and graphics (4*, 50*, 147*). The most comprehensive
estimates suggest there is enough multimodal data to support training runs a thousand to ten
million times larger than GPT-4’s in terms of compute size, which requires roughly ten times the
data (215, 225). However, these estimates are very uncertain, since it is difficult to gauge how well
training on one data modality impacts performance on another modality.
Machine-generated synthetic data could dramatically alleviate data bottlenecks, but evidence for
its utility is mixed. Training datasets can also be augmented by ‘synthetic’ general-purpose AI
outputs, which can be useful when real data is limited (226*, 227) or for improving model
generalisation (227, 228). However, some argue that naively training on general-purpose AI outputs
degrades performance or has rapidly diminishing returns (229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234*, 235, 236).
Others argue that these issues can be circumvented with better training techniques, such as by
mixing in ‘natural’ data (229, 231, 235, 237*, 238), improving data quality by (for example) using a
model to rate its quality (226*, 239*, 240, 241), and training on negative examples (i.e. teaching the
AI what not to do) (242*). Recent flagship models such as Llama 3 have made substantial use of
synthetic data during multiple stages of training (37*). The o1 model's recent improvements in
reasoning and programming tests were achieved largely by learning from its own self-generated
‘chains of thought’ – analysing which reasoning paths led to success or failure (2*).
Most existing successes with synthetic data have been restricted to certain domains. Synthetic
data training can be highly successful in domains where model outputs can be formally checked,
such as mathematics and programming (187*, 188, 243, 244*). However, it is still unclear whether
synthetic data training methods will be effective in domains where outputs cannot be easily
verified. One such example is medical research, where data often needs to be verified by
performing experiments lasting months or even years.

1.3.4. How much will AI capabilities be improved through the
invention or refinement of algorithms?
Existing techniques and training methods for general-purpose AI have been
improved and refined consistently

Algorithmic improvements allow general-purpose AI models to be trained with fewer resources.
The techniques and training methods underpinning the most capable general-purpose AI models
have consistently and reliably improved over time. The computational efficiency of AI techniques
for training has been increasing by 10x approximately every 2–5 years in key domains such as
image classification, game-playing, and language modelling (245*, 246). For example, the amount of
compute required to train a model to achieve a set level of performance at image classification
decreased by 44x between 2012 and 2019, meaning that efficiency doubled every 16 months.
Game-playing AI systems require half as many training examples every 5–20 months (247). In
language modelling, the compute required to reach a fixed performance level has halved
approximately every eight months on average since 2012 (246). This corresponds to a 3x
algorithmic training efficiency improvement per year, amounting to roughly a 27x total
improvement by the end of 2026. These advances have enabled general-purpose AI researchers
and companies to develop more capable models over time within a limited hardware budget.
Algorithmic innovations also occur across other dimensions, but these are less well-measured. For
example, new techniques have allowed general-purpose AI systems to process larger quantities of
contextual information for each query to the AI system (248*). Some algorithmic innovations also
help increase performance, allow general-purpose AI systems to use tools (22*), and better
leverage computation at deployment (94*). These capabilities vary along different dimensions, their
rates of improvement are challenging to measure, and they are often less well-understood.
Enhancements after pre-training can be used to significantly improve general-purpose AI model
capabilities at low cost. There is a rapidly growing body of work on algorithmic innovations after
initial training, such as improved fine-tuning, giving models access to software tools, and
structuring models’ outputs for reasoning tasks (see 1.2. Current capabilities). This means that a
wide range of actors, including low-resource actors, could use enhancements (sometimes called
‘post-training enhancements’) to advance general-purpose AI capabilities – an important factor for
governance to account for.
Capability progress from applying AI systems to AI development

General-purpose AI systems are increasingly deployed to automate and accelerate AI research and
development, and its effects on the pace of progress are understudied. Narrow AI systems have
already been used to develop and improve algorithms (249, 250), and design the latest AI chips

(251). Recent LLMs are widely used in areas related to AI R&D, particularly in programming (55),
generating and optimising prompts and training settings (252, 253, 254, 255), providing oversight
by replacing human feedback data (256*), and selecting high-quality training data (257*). Recent
prototypes also used LLMs to propose novel research ideas (258*). A recently released LLM-based
system performed competitively with typical human teams in real-world AI engineering
competitions (125*). A recent study comparing AI systems to expert human engineers found that
carefully tuned AI agents, built on state-of-the-art models, performed comparably to humans on AI
research engineering tasks that typically take engineers eight hours to complete (see Figure 1.9)
(259). The AI agents showed better performance than humans on tasks shorter than eight hours
but fell behind on longer ones, following a typical pattern seen in AI performance. AI engineering
tasks consume the largest portion of time in AI research and development work, making the
application of AI to these tasks particularly important (260). As the capabilities of general-purpose
AI systems advance, their overall effect on algorithmic progress and engineering in AI will require
more research to understand.

Figure 1.9: In a set of experiments, LLM-based AI agents released in 2024 performed better than expert human engineers
at open-ended AI research engineering tasks when both were given two hours or less to complete the work. Conversely,
human experts performed better when given eight hours or more. Different ‘system integrations’ refer to different ways
of using the same model, which can lead to varying performance. The shaded regions correspond to 95% confidence
intervals. Source: Wijk et al., 2024 (259).

Will the invention of novel approaches lead to rapid progress in coming years?

Sudden large and broad improvements in AI algorithms are rare but cannot be ruled out.
Fundamental conceptual breakthroughs are rare, and hard to predict since data on these is
relatively scarce. Such rare events cannot be easily forecasted by extrapolating past trends. At
best, statistical models that analyse past improvements on AI benchmarks find suggestive
evidence that sudden large performance improvements are unlikely but cannot be ruled out (261*).
The corpus of evidence in this area is highly limited and substantial uncertainty remains.
Even if developers achieve fundamental conceptual breakthroughs in algorithms, they might not
immediately lead to large capability improvements. For example, one study found that some
algorithmic innovations show more pronounced effects at larger scales than at smaller scales of
training compute (262*), making it hard to observe improvements in small experiments. Algorithmic
innovations also need to be optimised to work well with existing hardware, or to be integrated into
existing infrastructure or developer conventions (263, 264*, 265*). These pose barriers to
implementation at scale, so if a major conceptual breakthrough is required to overcome the
limitations of current general-purpose AI, it could take many years.

Policy challenges
As these technical trends continue, policymakers face new challenges in addressing the
societal impacts of general-purpose AI.
One challenge for policymakers is the limited availability of high-quality assessment data
about general-purpose AI capabilities. For instance, a major shortcoming with current
benchmarks is that they do not always accurately represent real-world capabilities.
Consequently, there has been an increase in efforts to build more challenging benchmarks and
to establish teams specialising in evaluating model capabilities (266*, 267, 268, 269). These
issues
with data quality are further compounded by the limited quantity of data, which means that
some estimates of the rate of AI progress (e.g. for algorithmic efficiency) are highly uncertain.
Navigating the uncertainty in the trajectory of future capabilities is a key challenge. Different
general-purpose AI capabilities could have substantially different ramifications for societal
impacts and AI policy. For example, the best estimates of the rate of algorithmic progress are
highly uncertain, but the specific rate has important implications for policy approaches that
emphasise monitoring training compute usage (270). On the whole there is much uncertainty
about future AI capabilities, and additional work on monitoring AI progress (for example with
improved benchmarks), as well as anticipating future progress, would be valuable.

2.1. Risks from malicious use
2.1.1. Harm to individuals through fake content
KEY INFORMATION
● Malicious actors can use general-purpose AI to generate fake content that harms
individuals in a targeted way. For example, they can use such fake content for scams,
extortion, psychological manipulation, generation of non-consensual intimate imagery
(NCII) and child sexual abuse material (CSAM), or targeted sabotage of individuals and
organisations.
● However, the scientific evidence on these uses is limited. Anecdotal reports of harm from
AI-generated fake content are common, but reliable statistics on the frequency and
impact of these incidents are lacking. Therefore, it is difficult to make precise statements
about the harms from fake content generated by general-purpose AI.
● In recent months, limited progress has been made in scientifically capturing the extent of
the problem. Since the publication of the Interim Report (May 2024), some new evidence
has suggested a significant increase in the prevalence of AI-generated deepfake content
online. Overall, reliable data on the full extent of the problem remains limited.
● Several mitigation techniques exist, but they all have serious limitations. Detection
techniques can sometimes help identify content generated by general-purpose AI, but
fundamental challenges remain. Media authentication techniques such as watermarks can
provide an additional line of defence, but moderately skilled actors can usually remove
them.
Key Definitions
● AI-generated fake content: Audio, text, or visual content, produced by generative AI, that
depicts people or events in a way that differs from reality in a malicious or deceptive way,
e.g. showing people doing things they did not do, saying things they did not say, changing
the location of real events, or depicting events that did not happen.
● Deepfake: A type of AI-generated fake content, consisting of audio or visual content, that
misrepresents real people as doing or saying something that they did not actually do or say.
Malicious actors can misuse AI-generated fake content to extort, scam, psychologically manipulate,
or sabotage targeted individuals or organisations (see Table 2.1) (271). This threatens universal
human rights, for example the right against attacks upon one’s honour and reputation (272). This
section focuses on harms caused to individuals through AI-generated fake content. Potential
impacts of AI-generated and -mediated influence campaigns on the societal level are covered in
2.1.2. Manipulation of public opinion.

abusing them and causing them psychological trauma. Victims are often children.
Table 2.1: AI-generated fake content has been used to cause different kinds of harm to individuals, including through
scams, blackmail, sabotage, and psychological abuse.
A key evidence gap around harm to individuals through fake content is the lack of
comprehensive and reliable statistics on the above harms, which makes precise assessment
of their frequency and severity difficult. Many experts believe that artificially generated fake
content, and especially sexual content, is on the rise, but most accounts of such cases remain
anecdotal. Key empirical evidence gaps pertain to the prevalence of deepfake financial fraud
and instances of extortion and sabotage. Reluctance to report may be contributing to these
challenges in understanding the full impact of AI-generated content intended to harm
individuals. For example, institutions often hesitate to disclose their struggles with
AI-powered fraud. Similarly, individuals attacked with AI-generated compromising material
about themselves may stay silent out of embarrassment and to avoid further harm (273).
Criminals can exploit AI-generated fake content to impersonate authority figures or trusted
individuals to commit financial fraud. There have been numerous cases in which criminals used
artificially generated audio and video clips to trick individuals into transferring money. For example,
phishing attacks can leverage AI-generated fake content to make fraudulent messages, calls, or
videos more convincing and effective, aiming to obtain sensitive information or money by
impersonating a trusted entity (273, 274). Incidents range from high-profile fraud cases where bank
executives were persuaded to transfer millions of dollars, to ordinary individuals being tricked into
transferring smaller sums to (supposedly) loved ones in need. AI-generated fake content can also
be used for identity theft, whereby a victim’s impersonated voice or likeness is used to authorise
bank transfers or to set up new bank accounts in a victim’s name. Alternatively, fake content can
also be used to trick system administrators into sharing password and username information that
can facilitate identity theft at a later date (275).
AI-generated fake content can also be used as blackmail for extortion. In such cases, criminals
demand money, business secrets, or nude images or videos, using compromising realistic
AI-generated content as leverage (276). Different types of AI-generated fake content – ranging
from video, voice clones, images, and more – can vary in their realism and effectiveness (277). The

fake content can feature any compromising or reputationally damaging activity, but has received
particular attention in cases of deepfake pornography, where general-purpose AI is used to create
pornographic or other intimate audiovisual representations of individuals without their consent
(278, 279, 280). This content is then used to extort victims for ransom – demanding money to
prevent the images from being released – or to gain compliance for other demands, such as
supplying additional illicit content.
Such compromising fake content can also be used to sabotage individuals in their personal and
professional lives, violating the human right against attacks upon one’s honour and reputation (272).
Compromising fake images and video – such as images of professional athletes taking drugs –
have, in some cases, resulted in reputational damage leading to lost opportunities and broken
business deals (271). The possibility of becoming the subject of harmful deepfake content and the
associated threat of reputational damage and psychological abuse to oneself and family can drive
people to disengage from publicly-visible activities such as politics and journalism, even when they
have not been directly targeted (281). However, the severity of this ‘silencing effect’ is difficult to
accurately estimate, as evidence at this stage is largely anecdotal.
Abuse using fake pornographic or intimate content overwhelmingly targets women and girls. A 2019
study found that 96% of deepfake videos are pornographic, and that all content on the five most
popular websites for pornographic deepfakes targets women (282). The same study found that the
vast majority of deepfake abuse (99% on deepfake porn sites and 81% on YouTube) is targeted at
female entertainers, followed by female politicians (12% on YouTube). Moreover, sexual deepfakes
are increasingly being used as a tool in intimate partner abuse, disproportionately affecting women
(271, 283). One nationally representative survey of 1,403 UK adults indicated that women were
significantly more likely than men to report being fearful of becoming a target of deepfake
pornography, becoming a target of a deepfake scam, and becoming a target of other potentially
harmful deepfakes (284*). This heightened concern among women could reflect an awareness of
their increased vulnerability to such abuse, suggesting a potential psychological impact of this
technology even on those not directly targeted. However, the sample size of the survey was limited
and not globally representative, and in general further research is needed to understand the
psychological impact of deepfakes on women.
Children face distinct types of harm from AI-generated sexual content. First, malicious actors can
harness AI tools to generate CSAM. In late 2023, an academic investigation found hundreds of
images of child sexual abuse in an open dataset used to train popular AI text-to-image generation
models such as Stable Diffusion (285). In the UK, of surveyed adults who reported being exposed to
sexual deepfakes in the last six months, 17% thought they had seen images portraying minors (286).
Second, children can also perpetrate abuse using AI. In the last year, schools have begun grappling
with a new issue as students use easily downloadable ‘nudify apps’ to generate and distribute
naked, pornographic pictures of their (disproportionately female) peers (287).
Risks
2.1 Risks from malicious use
65
Since the publication of the Interim Report, some new evidence has suggested a significant
prevalence of AI-generated content online. In the UK, a study found that 43% of people aged 16+
say that they have seen at least one deepfake (in the form of videos, voice imitations, and
images) online in the last six months (50% among children aged 8–15) (286). However, reliable
data remains comparably limited. Understanding the impact of deepfakes on individuals will
require more extensive research over an extended period of time.
Countermeasures that help people detect fake AI-generated content, such as warning labels and
watermarking, show mixed efficacy. Certain AI tools can help detect anomalies in images and flag
them as likely fake AI-generated content. This is done either by using machine learning algorithms
to look for specific features in fake images or by training deep neural networks to identify and
analyse anomalous image features independently (288). Warning labels on potentially misleading
content have shown limited effectiveness even in less harmful contexts – for example, in an
experimental study using AI-generated videos of a public figure alongside authentic clips, warning
labels only improved participants' detection rate from 10.7% to 21.6% (289). However, the
overwhelming majority of respondents who received warnings were still unable to distinguish
deepfakes from unaltered videos (289). Another authentication measure intended to prevent
AI-generated fake content is ‘watermarking’, which involves embedding a digital signature into the
content during creation. Watermarking techniques have shown promise in helping people identify
the origin and authenticity of digital media for videos (290, 291), images (292, 293, 294*), audio
(295, 296), and text (297). However, watermarking techniques face several limitations, including
watermark removal by sophisticated adversaries (298*, 299) and methods for tricking watermark
detectors (299). There are also concerns about privacy and potential misuse of watermarking
technology to track and identify users (300). Moreover, for many types of harmful content
discussed in this section, such as non-consensual pornographic or intimate content, the ability to
identify content as AI-generated does not necessarily prevent the harm from occurring. Even when
content is proven to be fake, the damage to reputation and relationships may persist, as people
often retain their initial emotional response to the content – for example, an individual's standing in
their community may not be restored simply by exposing the content as fake.
There are several key challenges facing policymakers working to mitigate harm to individuals
from AI-generated fake content. Assessing the scale of the problem is difficult due to
underreporting and lack of reliable statistics. This may make it difficult to determine the
appropriate intervention. Current detection methods and watermarking techniques, while
progressing, show mixed results and face persisting technical challenges. This means there is
currently no single robust solution for detecting and reducing the spread of harmful
AI-generated content. Finally, the rapid advancement of AI technology often outpaces
detection methods, highlighting potential limitations of relying solely on technical and reactive
interventions.

2.1.2. Manipulation of public opinion
KEY INFORMATION

● Malicious actors can use general-purpose AI to generate fake content such as text,
images, or videos, for attempts to manipulate public opinion. Researchers believe that if
successful, such attempts could have several harmful consequences.
● General-purpose AI can generate potentially persuasive content at unprecedented scale
and with a high degree of sophistication. Previously, generating content to manipulate
public opinion often involved a strong trade-off between quality and quantity.
General-purpose AI outputs, however, are often indistinguishable to people from content
generated by humans, and generating them is extremely cheap. Some studies have also
found them to be as persuasive as human-generated content.
● However, there is no scientific consensus on the expected impact of this potential abuse
of general-purpose AI. There is limited evidence on the broader societal effects of false
information, whether intentionally created or unknowingly shared, and whether AI-enabled
or not. Some researchers believe that attempts at manipulating public opinion using
general-purpose AI are most bottlenecked by a lack of effective distribution channels. This
view implies that advances in manipulative content generation should have a limited
impact on the efficacy of such campaigns.
● Since the publication of the Interim Report (May 2024), more research has emerged on
the virality of, and possible mitigations for, AI-based attempts at manipulation. A new
study finds that AI-generated manipulative content is perceived as less accurate but
shared at similar rates to human-generated content, which suggests that such content
can easily go viral regardless of whether it is AI or human-generated. New technical
detection methods integrating both text and visual data have shown some success, but
are not fully reliable.
● Policymakers face limited mitigation techniques and difficult trade-offs. Attempts to
address manipulation risk from general-purpose AI can, in some settings, be difficult to
reconcile with protection of free speech. Further, as general-purpose AI outputs become
increasingly persuasive and realistic, detecting cases of manipulation through AI can get
harder. Prevention techniques, such as watermarking content, are useful but can be
circumvented with moderate effort.

● AI agent: A general-purpose AI which can make plans to achieve goals, adaptively perform
tasks involving multiple steps and uncertain outcomes along the way and interact with its
environment – for example by creating files, taking actions on the web, or delegating tasks
to other agents – with little to no human oversight.
General-purpose AI can help people generate realistic content at scale, which malicious actors
could use for attempts to manipulate public opinion and spread certain narratives. Studies show
that humans often find general-purpose AI-generated text indistinguishable from genuine
human-generated material (301, 302, 303, 304). Moreover, research indicates that while people
struggle to accurately identify AI-generated content, they often overestimate their ability to do so
(305). There is also evidence that such content is already being disseminated at scale (306).
Recent research has observed a significant increase in AI-generated news articles (307), and has
found that AI language models can reduce content generation costs by up to 70% for highly reliable
models (308*).
There is evidence that content generated by general-purpose AI can be as persuasive as content
generated by humans, at least under experimental settings. Recent work has measured the
persuasiveness of general-purpose AI-generated political messages. Several studies have found
that they can influence readers’ opinions of psychological experiments (309, 310, 311, 312, 313*), in a
potentially durable fashion (314), though the generalisability to real-world contexts of these effects
remains understudied. One study found that during debates, people were just as likely to agree with
AI opponents as they were with human opponents (315), and more likely to be persuaded by the AI
if the AI had access to personal information of the kind that one can find on social media accounts.
Recent research also explores how general-purpose AI agents could influence user beliefs using
more sophisticated techniques, including by creating and exploiting users’ emotional dependence,
feeding their anxieties or anger, or threatening to expose information if users do not comply (316*).
As general-purpose AI systems grow in capability, there is evidence that it will become easier to
maliciously use them for deceptive or manipulative means, possibly even with higher effectiveness
than skilled humans, and to encourage users to take actions that are against their own best
interests (317, 318*). There is also some evidence that AI systems can use new AI-specific
manipulation tactics that humans are especially vulnerable to because our defences against
manipulation have been developed in response to other humans, not AIs (319). However, AI systems
can also be instrumental in mitigating AI-powered persuasion.
However, there is general debate regarding the impact of attempts to manipulate public opinion,
whether using general-purpose AI or not. A systematic review of relevant empirical studies on fake
news revealed that only eight out of the 99 reviewed studies attempted to measure direct impacts
(320). These studies generally found that the spread and consumption of fake news were limited
and highly concentrated among specific user groups, casting doubt on earlier hypotheses about its
widespread influence on election outcomes. However, these findings do not necessarily indicate a
high resilience to manipulation and persuasion attempts, and fake news can have broader or

unintended effects beyond its original purpose. Some studies suggest that while people can
theoretically discern true information from false information, they often lack the incentive to do so,
instead focusing on personal motivations or maximising engagement on social media (321, 322,
323). Regardless of the academic debate about effectiveness, public concern about AI-driven
attempts to manipulate public opinion remains high – for example, a 2024 survey found that a
majority of Americans across the political spectrum were highly concerned about AI being used to
create fake information about election candidates (324). However, this finding may not be
representative of global attitudes.
In addition, there is no consensus on whether the generation of more realistic fake content at scale
should be expected to lead to more effective manipulation campaigns, or whether the key
bottleneck for such campaigns is distribution (see Figure 2.1). Some experts have argued that the
main bottleneck for actors trying to have a large-scale impact with fake content is not generating
the content, but distributing it at scale (325). Similarly, some research suggests that ‘cheapfakes’
(less sophisticated methods of manipulating audiovisual content that are not dependent on
general-purpose AI use), might be as harmful as more sophisticated deepfakes (326). If true, this
would support the hypothesis that the quality of fake content is currently less decisive for the
success of a large-scale manipulation campaign than challenges around distributing that content
to many users. Social media platforms can employ various techniques for reducing the reach of
content likely to be of this nature. These techniques are often relatively effective, but there are
concerns about their impact on free speech. They include human content moderation, labelling of
potentially misleading content, and assessing source credibility. At the same time, research has
shown for years that social media algorithms often prioritise engagement and virality over the
accuracy or authenticity of content, which some researchers believe could aid the rapid spread of
AI-generated content generated to manipulate public opinion (327).
Researchers have also expressed broader concerns about the erosion of trust in the information
environment as AI-generated content becomes more prevalent. Some researchers worry that as
general-purpose AI capabilities grow and are increasingly used for generating and spreading
messages at scale, be they accurate, intentionally false, or unintentionally false, people might come
to generally distrust information more, which could pose serious problems for public deliberation.
Malicious actors could exploit such a generalised loss of trust by denying the truth of real,
unfavourable evidence, claiming that it is AI-generated – a phenomenon known as the 'liars’
dividend' (328, 329). However, society might also quickly adjust to AI-induced changes to the
information environment. In this more optimistic scenario, people might adapt their shared norms
for determining if a piece of information or source is credible or not. Society has adapted in this
way to past technological changes, such as the introduction of traditional image editing software.

While there is strong evidence for technical capability to create AI-generated content, evidence becomes sparse at later
stages, reflecting research gaps rather than a proven ineffectiveness of such campaigns. Note that societal impacts can
also occur through other mechanisms than depicted here, such as a general erosion of trust in information sources even
without measurable changes in individual beliefs. Source: International AI Safety Report.
Since the publication of the Interim Report, some new insights have emerged regarding
AI-generated content. One recent experimental study found that while people perceive
AI-generated fake news as less accurate than human-generated fake news (by about 20%),
they share both types at similar rates (approximately 12%), highlighting that fabricated
content, whether AI-generated or human-generated, can easily go viral (330). In the
experiment, nearly 99% of the study subjects failed to identify AI-generated fake news at
least once, which the authors attributed to the ability of state-of-the-art large LLMs to mimic
the style and content of reputable sources. New detection methods have successfully
combined textual and visual analysis, addressing previous limitations of approaches using
only one type of data such as only text or only images (331).
Current techniques for identifying content generated by general-purpose AI are helpful but often
easy to circumvent. Researchers have employed various methods to identify potential AI
authorship (332, 333). ‘Content analysis’ techniques explore statistical properties of text, such as
unusual character frequencies or inconsistent sentence length distributions, which deviate from
patterns typically observed in human writing (334, 335, 336). ‘Linguistic analysis’ techniques
examine stylistic elements, such as sentiment or named entity recognition, to uncover
inconsistencies or unnatural language patterns indicative of AI generation (337, 338). Researchers
can sometimes also detect AI-generated text by measuring how readable it is, as AI writing often
shows unusual patterns compared to human writing (339). However, not all AI-generated content is
fake news, and some research reveals an interesting bias in fake news detector tools: they tend to
disproportionately classify LLM-generated content as fake news, even when it is truthful (340). A
study of seven widely used AI content detectors identified another potential limitation of these

tools: they displayed a bias against non-native English writers, often misclassifying their work as
AI-generated (341). Finally, AI researchers have also proposed other approaches for detecting
AI-generated content, such as ‘watermarking’, in which an invisible signature identifies digital
content as generated or altered by AI. Watermarking can help with the detection of AI-generated
content, but can usually be circumvented by moderately sophisticated actors, as is discussed in
2.1.1. Harm to individuals through fake content.
Early experiments demonstrate that human collaboration with AI can improve the detection of
AI-generated text. This approach increased detection accuracy by 6.36% for non-experts and
12.76% for experts compared to individual efforts in a recent study (342). While purely
human-based collaborative detection is likely not scalable for dealing with the vast amount of
content generated daily, the research still remains valuable. For example, data from human
collaboration can be used to train and improve AI detection systems. Moreover, for particularly
challenging or high-stakes content, human collaboration can supplement AI detection. However, the
long-term effect of such collaborative efforts on public resilience to manipulation attempts
remains to be seen, and further studies are required to validate these initial findings.
For policymakers working on reducing the risk of AI-aided manipulation of public opinion,
there are several challenges. These include mitigation attempts with protection of free speech
(343, 344) and determining appropriate legal liability frameworks (345, 346, 347).
Policymakers also face uncertainty about the actual impact of manipulation campaigns, given
mixed evidence on their effectiveness and limited data on their prevalence (see Figure 2.1).
Another challenge is the ongoing evolution of AI, adaptive user behaviours, and continuous
improvements in AI systems, which creates a perpetual cycle of adaptation and
counter-adaptation between detection methods and AI-generated content.

2.1.3. Cyber offence
KEY INFORMATION†


● Attackers are beginning to use general-purpose AI for offensive cyber operations,
presenting growing but currently limited risks. Current systems have demonstrated
capabilities in low- and medium-complexity cybersecurity tasks, with state-sponsored
threat actors actively exploring AI to survey target systems. Malicious actors of varying
skill levels can leverage these capabilities against people, organisations, and critical
infrastructure such as power grids.
● Cyber risk arises because general-purpose AI enables rapid and parallel operations at
scale and lowers technical barriers. While expert knowledge is still essential, AI tools
reduce the human effort and knowledge needed to survey target systems and gain
unauthorised access.
● General-purpose AI offers significant dual-use cyber capabilities. Evidence indicates that
general-purpose AI could accelerate processes such as discovering vulnerabilities, which
are essential for launching attacks as well as strengthening defences. However, resource
constraints and regulations may prevent critical services and smaller organisations from
adopting AI-enhanced defences. The ultimate impact of AI on the attacker-defender
balance remains unclear.
● Since the publication of the Interim Report (May 2024), general-purpose AI systems have
shown significant progress in identifying and exploiting cyber vulnerabilities. AI systems
have autonomously found and exploited vulnerabilities in real open source software
projects. Recent research prototypes have autonomously found and exploited
vulnerabilities that take the fastest human security teams minutes to find, but struggle
with more complex scenarios. General-purpose AI was also used to find and fix a
previously unknown exploitable vulnerability in widely used software (SQLite).
● In principle, the risk appears at least partially manageable, but there are key assessment
challenges. Rapid advancements in capabilities make it difficult to rule out large-scale
risks in the near term, thus highlighting the need for evaluating and monitoring these risks.
Better metrics are needed to understand real-world attack scenarios, particularly when
humans and AIs work together. A critical challenge is mitigating offensive capabilities
without compromising defensive applications.

● Ransomware: A type of malware that locks or encrypts a user’s files or system, making them
inaccessible until a ransom (usually money) is paid to the attacker.
● Hacking: The act of exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses in a computer system, network,
or software to gain unauthorised access, manipulate functionality, or extract information.
● Penetration testing: A security practice where authorised experts or AI systems simulate
cyberattacks on a computer system, network or application to proactively evaluate its
security. The goal is to identify and fix weaknesses before they can be exploited by real
attackers.
● CTF (Capture the Flag) challenges: Exercises often used in cybersecurity training, designed
to test and improve the participants’ skills by challenging them to solve problems related to
cybersecurity, such as finding hidden information or bypassing security defences.
● Zero-day vulnerability: An undiscovered or unpatched security flaw in software or hardware.
As attackers can already exploit it, developers have ‘zero days’ to fix it.
● Hardware backdoor: A feature of a device, intentionally or unintentionally created by a
manufacturer or third party, that can be used to bypass security protections in order to
monitor, control, or extract data without the user’s knowledge.

Offensive cyber operations typically involve designing and deploying malicious software (malware)
and exploiting vulnerabilities in software and hardware systems, leading to severe security
breaches. A standard attack chain begins with reconnaissance of the target system, followed by
iterative discovery, exploitation of vulnerabilities, and additional information gathering. These
actions demand careful planning and strategic execution to achieve the adversary's objectives
while avoiding detection. Some experts are concerned that general-purpose AI could enhance
these operations by automating vulnerability detection, optimising attack strategies, and improving
evasion techniques (348, 349). These advanced capabilities would benefit all attackers. For
instance, state actors could leverage them to target critical national infrastructure (CNI), resulting in
widespread disruption and significant damage. At the same time, general-purpose AI could also be
used defensively, for example to find and fix vulnerabilities.
General-purpose AI can assist with information-gathering tasks, thereby reducing human effort. For
example, in ransomware attacks, malicious actors first manually conduct offensive reconnaissance
and exploit vulnerabilities to gain entry to the target network, and then release malware that
spreads without human intervention (350). The entry phase is often technically challenging and
prone to failure. General-purpose AI is being explored by state-sponsored attackers as an aid to
speed up the process (351*, 352*). However, while there are general-purpose systems that have
performed vulnerability discovery autonomously (see next paragraphs), published systems have
not yet autonomously executed real-world intrusions into networks and systems – tasks that are
inherently more complex.

Figure 2.2: Recent advances in AI models' ability to find and exploit cybersecurity vulnerabilities autonomously has grown
across multiple benchmarks. On DARPA and ARPA-H's AI Cyber Challenge (353, 359), OpenAI's new o1 model (Sept 2024)
substantially outperformed GPT-4o (May 2024), autonomously detecting 79% of vulnerabilities compared to 21% for
GPT-4o. Testing on Cybench (358) showed vulnerability detection rates improving from 10% (Claude 3 Opus, March
2024) to 17.5% (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, June 2024). OpenAI's internal CTF hacking competition evaluations at high school
level rose from 20% to 43%, though models still struggle with more complex benchmark tasks (2*). Only the
best-performing new model for each month is shown. Sources: Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, 2024
(353); Ristea et al., 2024 (359); Zhang et al., 2024 (358); OpenAI, 2024 (2*).
General-purpose AI can assist attackers with vulnerability discovery (VD) in source code to some
extent, but traditional methods remain dominant for now. In this task, the analyst examines the
source code of a software project (such as an open source web server or firewall) to identify
exploitable security flaws.
Since the publication of the Interim Report, the cyber capabilities of general-purpose AI in
vulnerability discovery have increased significantly. At the DARPA AIxCC challenge (353)
participants developed systems capable of autonomously finding, exploiting, and fixing
vulnerabilities in real open source software projects using general-purpose AI (354, 355, 356).

widely used open source software SQLite (357*). In this case, the discovery was used to fix
rather than exploit the vulnerability. Penetration testing benchmarks (metrics) have also
advanced considerably, providing a much clearer signal of the models’ capabilities and
improvement over time (358).

General-purpose AI has shown low to moderate success in automating system and network
hacking. Unlike automated vulnerability detection in software, where AI systems rely on access to
source code, hacking is more challenging for AI, as it must execute every step of an attack with little
or no prior knowledge of the target system's inner workings (for example, gathering information on
the target, finding entry points, breaking in, moving through the system and achieving its goal).
Real-world hacking operations require exploratory actions and iterative adjustments to understand
a target system’s operation, often involving hypothesis testing and shifting strategy dynamically
(360). These tasks have resisted full automation because they require an exceptional level of
precision – where even a single incorrect character in an input can cause the entire approach to fail
– and involve resolving multiple complex subtasks without explicit guidance or feedback.
Since the publication of the Interim Report, general-purpose AI’s cybersecurity attack
capabilities have improved, but AI models still cannot beat human experts and they struggle
with more complex scenarios. CTF challenges, where the attacker has to identify and exploit
vulnerabilities to gain access to protected data or systems, have emerged as a typical
cybersecurity benchmark. Before the Interim Report (May 2024), general-purpose AI could
carry out simple attacks (127, 361, 362*) but not sophisticated ones. Since then, further
research has managed to achieve better results with AI systems. For example, teams of LLM
agents can collaborate effectively to find previously unknown (‘zero-day’) vulnerabilities,
albeit not highly complicated ones (363). Additionally, access to better tools (364) and the
introduction of modules that enable step-by-step reasoning (365) have enabled
general-purpose AI models to solve tasks from established CTF challenges (easy and medium
difficulty). However, without these reasoning aids, Google reports that their latest model,
Gemini 1.5, shows no performance gains on their CTF benchmarks compared to prior versions,
and it only shows improvements in simple offensive cybersecurity tasks (49*). OpenAI reports
that while its recent o1 model improves over the benchmark scores of GPT4o, it is still
classified as ‘low-risk’ in this area and remains within manageable misuse limits (2*). Various
models and collaborations between models achieve performance comparable to humans who
are given around 35 minutes per task: baseline Sonnet 3.5, o1-preview advising o1-preview
(both versions), and o1-mini advising GPT-4o (129). This collaborative dynamic, where models
advise and refine each other's outputs is increasingly useful for multi-step error-intolerant
tasks such as cyber offence (see also section 1.2. Current capabilities). Models without
guidance were not able to solve CTF challenges that took the best human expert teams more
than 11 minutes of work (358). As expected, more recent models (e.g. OpenAI’s GPT-4o and
o1-preview) perform better but still struggle to generate insights that take experts longer to
figure out.
 
Risks
2.1 Risks from malicious use

General-purpose AI systems can reduce the technical knowledge and expertise required to carry
out individual steps of the attack chain. In a typical attack chain, an attacker might start with
reconnaissance to identify potential vulnerabilities, use a phishing campaign to gain initial access,
obtain privileges within the target system, move laterally across the network, and ultimately
exfiltrate sensitive data or deploy ransomware. By automating or assisting with parts of the attack
chain, general-purpose AI lessens the need for expert involvement, thereby lowering the barrier to
entry for more sophisticated attacks. However, while AI can accelerate the process of reviewing
publicly available information, this does not automatically result in advanced expertise. In domains
such as vulnerability exploitation, general-purpose AI can assist, but experts still need to
incorporate significant domain-specific knowledge to make these AI systems effective (353, 366*),
a need that has not changed since the Interim Report.
State-sponsored hacking groups have reportedly used general-purpose AI to support hacking. For
example, such groups have used general-purpose AI for translating technical papers, analysing
publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, researching public protocols (e.g. satellite communications),
assisting with scripting, troubleshooting errors, and developing detection evasion techniques for
malware and intrusions (351*).
General-purpose AI is likely to tip the current balance in favour of the attackers only under specific
conditions: 1. if general-purpose AI automates tasks that are needed for attack but not the
corresponding defences; or 2. if cutting-edge general-purpose AI capabilities are accessible to
adversaries but not equally available to all defenders. In particular, small and medium enterprises
(SMEs) may not be able to afford general-purpose AI-enhanced defence solutions. For example,
hospitals, constrained by limited security resources and the complexity of heterogeneous legacy
networks, may be slower to adopt AI-driven defences, leaving their highly sensitive data more
exposed to sophisticated cyberattacks. Similarly, CNI systems (such as electricity substations)
often have strict criteria and are cautious in adopting new technologies, including AI-based
defences, due to security concerns and governance and/or regulatory requirements. In contrast,
adversaries are not bound by such constraints and can adopt advanced AI capabilities more
rapidly.
Even if AI-driven detection catches vulnerabilities in new code before it reaches production, a
major challenge remains: source code that is already in use and predates these capabilities. Much
of this legacy code has not been scrutinised by advanced AI tools, leaving potential vulnerabilities
undetected. Patching these vulnerabilities after discovery is a slow process, particularly in
production environments where changes require rigorous testing to avoid disrupting operations.
For example, the Heartbleed vulnerability continued to expose systems for weeks after a patch was
available, as administrators faced delays in implementing it (367). This situation will potentially
create a critical transition period, wherein defenders must manage and patch older, unvetted code
while attackers, unencumbered by such constraints and potentially equipped with advanced AI, can
exploit these vulnerabilities with less effort (a capability asymmetry). During this transition, the
disparity in AI adoption – especially among SMEs and critical infrastructure systems that are slower 
Risks
2.1 Risks from malicious use
77
to integrate new technologies like AI – could amplify the imbalance between attackers and
defenders.
The defensive counterparts to certain offensive tasks are considerably more complex, creating
asymmetry in the effectiveness of general-purpose AI when used by attackers versus defenders.
For example, attackers using general-purpose AI can stealthily embed threats at the hardware level
(368) in ways that are inherently difficult for defenders to predict or detect. Thus, attackers control
how concealed and complex the vulnerabilities are, while defenders must anticipate and detect
these deliberately obscured threats. The Stuxnet malware (369) demonstrated how such attacks
can cause physical damage by targeting industrial control systems – it disrupted Iran's nuclear
facilities by manipulating hardware operations. While there is no public evidence that AI has been
used to automate and escalate such threats in production systems, its potential impact on
cybersecurity warrants careful monitoring. On the other hand, some AI applications could offer
asymmetric benefits to defenders as well. For example, AI could enhance the security of chips –
such as those used in smartphones – by detecting and mitigating vulnerabilities during the design
process (370). Additionally, general-purpose AI has already been integrated in auditing and
debugging tools (371*, 372*).
The main evidence gaps around current AI cyber capabilities include:
● Comprehensive capability assessment: more empirical studies are needed to evaluate AI
performance across complex, real-world attack chains and to track capability trends,
particularly for multi-step attack automation. Existing benchmarks such as CTF challenges
offer partial insights but often fail to capture the full scope of AI-driven offensive
capabilities. For example, benchmarking in specialised environments, such as
cyber-physical infrastructure testbeds, would allow for a more realistic assessment of AI’s
impact in high-stakes scenarios. Additionally, the lack of human performance baselines
makes it difficult to contextualise the complexity of tasks in terms of human-hours,
hindering accurate comparisons of AI and human capability.
● Evaluating human-AI collaborative offence: research into how attackers could leverage AI
alongside human expertise is essential to understand potential offensive advancements.
Studies should explore how AI can enhance human-led operations in areas such as
strategic decision-making, resource allocation, and real-time adjustments, potentially
increasing both the effectiveness and sophistication of cyberattacks. Moreover, AI models
often produce ‘near misses’ that humans with moderate cyber experience could readily
address, suggesting a synergistic benefit when humans and AI collaborate in offensive
efforts.
Policymakers focusing on cyber risks will face challenges including reliably assessing the risks
and capabilities of AI in offensive and defensive contexts. Cyber risk benchmarks can
sometimes overstate performance compared to real-life scenarios because they often use
challenges and code sourced from platforms such as GitHub, which models may have
encountered during training. As a result, these models might already be familiar with the code 
Risks
2.1 Risks from malicious use
78
or have benefited from tutorials and solution manuals found in blogs and other online
resources. However, capability assessments can also be understated because it is difficult to
elicit a system’s full capabilities (1.2. Current capabilities). Additionally, the success rates
reported in benchmarks typically exclude near misses (instances where the AI model almost
succeeds in the attack) (358), which could easily be exploited by a human operator to
complete the attack.

Policymakers will also face significant challenges in regulating offensive AI research while
retaining defensive capabilities. Offensive cyber research is important for maintaining robust
defences, and restricting it could weaken national security strategies, especially if other
nations do not impose similar limitations. Policymakers need to weigh the risks of misuse
against the benefit of such research and find opportunities to reduce misuse risks while
protecting defensive applications (see 3.3. Risk identification and assessment for further
discussion on evaluating risks and harmful capabilities). Another critical issue is managing the
trade-offs involved in openly releasing general-purpose AI model weights, which carries both
significant benefits and risks of misuse, as explored in 2.4. Impact of open-weight generalpurpose AI models on AI risks.

KEY INFORMATION†


● Growing evidence shows general-purpose AI advances beneficial to science while also
lowering some barriers to chemical and biological weapons development for both novices
and experts. New language models can generate step-by-step technical instructions for
creating pathogens and toxins that surpass plans written by experts with a PhD and
surface information that experts struggle to find online, though their practical utility for
novices remains uncertain. Other models demonstrate capabilities in engineering
enhanced proteins and analysing which candidate pathogens or toxins are most harmful.
Experts could potentially use these in developing both more advanced weapons and
defensive measures.
● The real-world impact of AI on developing and using weapons including pandemic
pathogens remains unclear due to secrecy requirements, testing prohibitions, and a need
for better evaluations. Key evidence about malicious actors, their technical bottlenecks,
and AI safety assessments relating to biological weapons are kept confidential to prevent
misuse. Testing is often prohibited given the severe dangers these weapons pose. More
evaluations are needed to assess how strongly current systems can aid the many steps of
weapons development; substantial expertise and resources remain necessary barriers.
● In recent months, advances have generated greater evidence of risk and expanded the
biological capabilities of general-purpose AI, and there are emerging efforts to develop
best practices for evaluation. Since the Interim Report (May 2024), general-purpose
language models have made substantial advances in tests of biological weapons expertise
and general scientific reasoning. AI has also demonstrated new capabilities in protein
design and in working with multiple types of scientific data – including chemicals, proteins,
and DNA – enhancing its ability to design complex biological structures. The implications
for risks are still being studied, with initial evidence suggesting a rise in potential risks
alongside benefits.
● If rapid advancement continues, this creates urgent policy challenges for evaluating and
managing biological risks. Recent rapid advances in risk benchmarks make it increasingly
hard to rule out large-scale risks in near-future models. Policymakers need to make
decisions with incomplete information and integrate classified threat research. Adding to
these challenges are the ongoing debates over the risk-benefit trade-offs of releasing
open-weight models, particularly AI tools for creating biological and chemical structures,
and the fact that policies that depend on humans to detect risk and intervene may be too
slow to address the current pace of development.

● Dual-use science: Research and technology that can be applied for beneficial purposes,
such as medicine or environmental solutions, but also potentially misused to cause harm,
such as in biological or chemical weapon development.
● Toxin: A poisonous substance produced by living organisms (such as bacteria, plants, or
animals), or synthetically created to mimic a natural toxin, that can cause illness, harm, or
death in other organisms depending on its potency and the exposure level.
● Pathogen: A microorganism, for example a virus, bacterium, or fungus, that can cause

● Agent: For the purposes of this section, ‘agent’ usually refers to a biological, chemical, or

confused with AI agents (see below).
● AI agent: A general-purpose AI which can make plans to achieve goals, adaptively perform
tasks involving multiple steps and uncertain outcomes along the way, and interact with its
environment – for example by creating files, taking actions on the web, or delegating tasks
to other agents – with little to no human oversight.
● Biosecurity: A set of policies, practices, and measures (e.g. diagnostics and vaccines)
designed to protect humans, animals, plants, and ecosystems from harmful biological agents,
whether naturally occurring or intentionally introduced.
The risks associated with dual-use science are a significant focus in international AI safety policy;
this section focuses on chemical and biological weapons but there are also risks concerning
radiological and nuclear weapons. These weapons of mass destruction, originally developed
through scientific research intended for peaceful purposes, exemplify the phenomenon of ‘dual-use
science’ – where innovations are repurposed for military applications. Among these, the focus of
this section is on chemical and biological weapons which are of particular concern due to the
relative ease of obtaining necessary materials and the widespread availability of related
information. As a result, biological weapon risks have taken centre stage in AI safety summits and
broader conversations about the potential catastrophic impacts of advanced AI. In contrast, the
risk of AI expanding access to nuclear and radiological weapons is considered lower, primarily
because of the significant barriers to acquiring the requisite materials. However, AI's involvement in
nuclear decision-making would introduce unique risks. Some experts voice concerns that
delegating decision-making authority for nuclear weapon launches to AI systems could increase
the likelihood of critical errors (see 2.2.1. Reliability issues) or a loss of control (see 2.2.3. Loss of
control) (373). Dual-use science risks extend to other advances such as navigation systems,
nanotechnology, autonomous robots and drones, all of which have military applications that are
beyond the scope of this report.

performance scores, calculated as percentage accuracies for recently published results compared to previous
state-of-the-art results. Recent advancements in LLMs were especially rapid, comparing GPT4o (released May 2024) to
o1 (released September 2024). Notable advances are LLMs’ accuracy in answering questions about the release of
bioweapons, which increased from 15% to 80%, and biological AIs’ ability to predict how proteins interact with small
molecules (including in both medicines and chemical weapons), which increased from 42% to 90% during 2024. Due to a
lack of standardised benchmarks, and inconsistencies in the way that accuracy is calculated, comparisons are limited to
a few tasks and are not consistently repeated over time. Sources: OpenAI, 2024 (2*) (for LLMs); Abramson et al., 2024

Some general-purpose AI has been developed specifically for scientific domains, offering general
capabilities for understanding and designing chemicals, DNA and proteins. Models trained on
scientific data range in their abilities, from narrow applications such as predicting the structure of
proteins, to offering a variety of prediction and design capabilities. In this report, broadly capable

there is substantial debate within the AI and biology communities regarding the point at which a
model trained on scientific data can be called a ‘general-purpose model’ (see Introduction for a
definition) or ‘foundation model’ (45). For example, AlphaFold2 was designed for the narrow task of
protein structure prediction but, through fine-tuning, has been found to be applicable to a high
variety of other tasks, such as predicting protein interactions, predicting small molecular binding
sites, and predicting and designing cyclic peptides (374). For these reasons, it satisfies this report’s
definition of a general-purpose AI model. AlphaFold3 has been able to achieve these tasks at
greater accuracy, and across a wider range of molecules, even without fine-tuning (23). These
scientifically geared AI tools amplify the potential for chemical and biological innovation by
accelerating scientific discovery, optimising production, and enabling the precise design of new
biological parts. They also offer promising opportunities to develop new medicines and better
combat infectious diseases (375, 376). These tools have generated substantial advancements in
science, sufficient to earn their creators the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (377).
The dual-use nature of scientific progress poses complex risks, as innovations meant for beneficial
purposes, such as medicine, have historically led to the creation of chemical and biological
weapons (378, 379). The vast majority of harms from toxins and infectious diseases have resulted
from naturally occurring events, sparking extensive research to help combat these threats. The
intentional development and deployment of biological weapons was informed by this research, but
poses substantial difficulties (380, 381). Many believe that advances in the design, optimisation and
production of chemical and biological products, in part due to AI, may have made the development
of chemical and biological weapons easier (382, 383, 384, 385). Evidence discussed in this section
suggests that general-purpose AI amplifies weapons risks by helping novices (typically defined as
people with a bachelor's degree or less in a relevant discipline) to create or access existing
biological and chemical weapons, and allowing experts (typically referring to someone with a PhD or
higher in a relevant discipline) to design more dangerous or targeted weapons, or create existing
weapons with less effort.
Since the publication of the Interim Report, general-purpose AI models’ ability to reason and
integrate different data types has improved, and progress has been made in formulating best
practices for biosecurity. Several models have been published since the Interim Report (May
2024) that integrate different types of scientific data; one foundation model for scientific
data, AlphaFold 3, can predict the structure of, and interactions between, a range of molecules
including chemicals, DNA, and proteins with greater accuracy than the previous
state-of-the-art (see Figure 2.3) (23), and another, ESM3, can simultaneously model protein
sequence, structure, and function (386*). These developments open up new possibilities for
designing biological products that do not strongly resemble natural ones (387*). The recently
released o1, a general-purpose language model, has significantly improved performance in
tests of biological risk measures (also shown in Figure 2.3) and general scientific reasoning
compared to previous state-of-the-art models (2*). Efforts to formulate biosecurity best
practices have advanced, with the Frontier Model Forum and the AI x Bio Global Forum
facilitating discussions on risk evaluation and mitigation for these models (388, 389).

for creating chemical and biological weapons. LLMs can aid in the planning and acquisition stages, advise on performing
laboratory work to build and test a design, and aid in planning the effective release or delivery of a product. AI agents,
robotics platforms, and biological or chemical design tools (general-purpose or specialised) can aid in the design,
building, testing and refinement of pathogens and toxins. Specialised AI can assist with mass production and formulation.

LLMs can now provide detailed, step-by-step plans for creating chemical and biological weapons,
improving on plans written by people with a relevant PhD. Although information about how to
create chemical and biological threats has long been accessible due to its dual-use nature, tests of
LLMs show that they help novices synthesise this information, allowing them to develop plans
faster than with the internet alone (391) (for the ‘Planning’ and ‘Release’ phases in Figure 2.4). These
capabilities lower barriers for people to access complex scientific information, which can likely
provide broad benefits but can also lower barriers to misusing this information. GPT-4, released in
2023, correctly answered 60–75% of bioweapons-relevant questions (392), but a range of models
tested provided no significant improvement over biological weapon plans developed using only the
internet (37*, 393, 394*). However, the recent o1 model produces plans rated superior to plans
generated by experts with a PhD 72% of the time and provides details that expert evaluators could
not find online (2*). OpenAI concluded that their o1 models could meaningfully assist experts in the
operational planning of reproducing known biological threats, leading OpenAI to increase their
assessment of biological risks from ‘low’ to ‘medium’. However, OpenAI did not assess the models’
usefulness for novices (2*), underscoring the need for more research. Successfully developing and
deploying bioweapons still requires significant expertise, materials and skilled physical work (380,
381), meaning that even if a novice has a well-formulated plan, this does not imply that they could
successfully carry it out.
Evidence shows that general-purpose AI can, in some instances, instruct users on how to
acquire dangerous biological and chemical agents by circumventing traditional controls.
Restricted access to dangerous materials and some of their precursors has been a key
defence against biological and chemical threats (the ‘Acquisition’ phase in Figure 2.4).
However, sometimes biological agents can be sourced from nature or synthesised from DNA,
and skilled chemists can identify alternative routes to creating some chemical weapons,
circumventing controls. General-purpose AI can assist in identifying these alternative

84
acquisition routes, lowering barriers to access and creating risks of accidents or misuse (120).
Several studies suggest that AI could also undermine existing controls on access to risky DNA
sequences. Many commercial providers of DNA screen their orders for similarity to known
biological hazards in order to comply with regulatory controls and prevent the misuse of these
materials. However, LLMs can guide customers to purchase DNA from providers that do not
screen, or suggest methods to fool screening software (391). Furthermore, a recent study
found that some screening software fails to detect a large proportion of DNA that is designed
by specialised AI tools to function in the same way as these hazards but appear dissimilar.
Fortunately, the same study found that it is possible to update current systems to detect
around 97% of these designs (395).
AI's ability to design highly targeted medical treatments has increased substantially since the
Interim Report, and chat interfaces are expanding access, also heightening the risk of more potent
toxins being created (384). Both specialised and general-purpose AI tools can now design
candidate therapeutic molecules for complex diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and
neurological conditions (the ‘Design’ phase in Figure 2.4) (396). For instance, AlphaProteo can
design proteins that attach to targets up to 300x more strongly than existing alternatives,
potentially making them more effective at lower doses (387*). However, precise targeting of these
systems could also be used for malicious purposes (397). AI-driven chemical design tools intended
to reduce toxicity have been repurposed in research studies to increase it, potentially aiding in the
design of chemical weapons (398), and some tools have been specifically designed for toxin
creation (399). Access to specialised design tools varies: some are restricted to trusted partners
(387*), while others are open-weight and can thus be used by anyone (399). Although many of
these tools are too complex for use by novices, chatbots and AI agents are being integrated with
some design tools (400*, 401*, 402), allowing users to request designs in plain language. Today, this
integration still requires technical knowledge for effective use. A direct assessment of the risks
these tools pose for toxin weapon development is likely to be constrained in countries that adhere
to international treaty commitments (403).
General-purpose AI enhances researchers’ ability to predict important properties of pathogens,
potentially aiding in both bioweapon and countermeasure design. AI tools are being developed to
predict new virus variants before they emerge and to assess properties such as their ability to
infect humans (404, 405) and evade immune detection (390). These advances potentially enable
proactive vaccine development for high-risk virus variants that have not yet emerged, or the
malicious design of viruses that can bypass existing immunity in the population (390, 406) (the
‘Design’ phase in Figure 2.4). General-purpose AI models trained on biological data are beginning to
underpin these specialised applications. For instance, the tool EVEscape, which leverages a DNA
foundation model (407) and relies on protein structure predictions which are increasingly
generated using AI, predicted 66% of SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus) variants that later became
dominant – far exceeding previous models (17% success) (see Figure 2.3) (390). Tools that design
viruses which evade the human immune system and target specific cells are useful for gene
therapy applications, but they also pose dual-use risks (408), such as enhancing bioweapons (382, 
Risks
2.1 Risks from malicious use
85
384) or targeting specific populations (384). Simple modifications to existing pathogens could
significantly increase their risk. For example, in research performed without using AI, bird flu viruses
which can be lethal to humans have been modified by researchers to spread through airborne
droplets (409). Indeed, some experts believe that engineered diseases could be far worse than any
occurring naturally (384, 410). Investigation of AI systems’ ability to create more dangerous
pathogens may be constrained by both international treaty commitments and the risk of accidental
release of pathogen variants being tested.
General-purpose AI can help plan and guide laboratory work, but it often omits critical safety
information, and tests of real-world success using this assistance have not been published. At the
time of the Interim Report (May 2024), LLM-generated lab plans showed no significant
improvement over those compiled from the internet (393) (the ‘Build’ phase in Figure 2.4). However,
the o1 model produced laboratory instructions that were preferred over PhD-written ones 80% of
the time (up from 55% for GPT-4), with its accuracy in identifying errors in lab plans increasing from
57% to 73% (2*). Despite this, the omission of crucial safety details – such as when an experiment
would produce an explosive intermediate, or when protective equipment should be worn to
complete a task – remains a significant concern that could result in serious accidents (2*).
Evaluations of how well novices perform lab work under LLM instruction have not yet been released
publicly, making the credibility of these risks an area of substantial debate.
Laboratory and design automation accelerate the refinement of biological designs. This potentially
lowers barriers to AI-designed products (including weapons), but limited implementation
complicates risk assessment. Biochemical designs often go through ‘Design-Build-Test-Learn’
(DBTL) cycles to test and improve on promising initial designs (shown in Figure 2.4). AI-driven tools
automate these cycles for better results in less time (411, 412, 413, 414). ‘Self-driving labs’ or ‘robot
scientists’, a nascent area of scientific development, can complete these cycles without human
intervention (412, 415, 416): one instance completed 20 rounds of design improvement in two
months – or 1–2 weeks of uninterrupted production – compared to 6–12 months manually (417). AI
agents are expected to play a growing role in this process (402, 415), and studies suggest that
robotic systems can digitally capture some of the fine motor skills required to successfully execute
experiments that novices traditionally acquired through years of hands-on experience (384, 418). If
intricate experimental skills are captured by robotics platforms, then advanced biological
capabilities would become more accessible to actors with less technical skill, but this has not been
systematically tested for laboratory skills required for biological weapons development. Full
automation of laboratory work is still a challenge, for example due to machine failures (416).
AI applications in biotechnology are lowering some barriers to the weaponisation and delivery of
chemical and biological agents, but these stages remain technically complex. Challenges such as
mass production, stabilisation, and effective dispersal have caused failures in state-sponsored
weapons programmes (380, 381) and late-stage therapeutics (419, 420) (the ‘Mass production and
formulation’ and ‘Release’ phases in Figure 2.4). Foundation models trained on protein data have
improved the efficiency of protein functions (up to 60%) so less product is needed, improved yield 
Risks
2.1 Risks from malicious use
86
by 4x, and improved the stability of materials by 20% (421), enabling better production of products
that could be used as weapons or therapeutics. However, the mass production of entire organisms
remains difficult and AI applications that attempt to aid this process remain narrow in their
capabilities (422). Simple AI models can also offer basic support for formulating delivery methods,
such as powders and aerosols (423), a process which has been considered a major barrier to
success (in both weapons and therapeutics development) (424). Although a recently developed
LLM achieved 100% and 80% success respectively in simulated mass production and delivery tasks
(2*), details of these tests are not available, so it is unclear how well they capture the practical
challenges associated with these steps.
Key evidence gaps include a lack of transparency and consistency in safety evaluations and
challenges in measuring biological design capabilities. AI evaluations may define ‘novices’ as
members of the public, or people with a bachelor's degree in a specific field, while ‘experts’
may be people who hold a PhD in a relevant discipline, or people with decades of experience
in a specialist subject. In some assessments, these terms are not defined, making it difficult to
assess how much models improve human abilities, and how many people would be able to
effectively harness these capabilities. While many studies have explored AI’s role in biological
weapon development (2*, 51*, 318*, 393, 425, 426*), AI biosecurity evaluation is still a nascent
field, with few standardised benchmarks or risk assessments, making it difficult to compare
capabilities and measure the risk created by a new tool compared to pre-existing
technologies (called ‘marginal risk’). Assessments of AI protein and chemical design
capabilities are particularly difficult, as they require a costly process of building and testing
the designs. Key information on risks is unlikely to be made publicly available due to
confidentiality agreements and concerns over the potential for raising awareness of more
promising avenues for weaponising biology (427). A final challenge is assessing the overall risk
of biological and chemical weapons development and deployment, rather than evaluating
tools and capabilities in isolation.
Efforts to limit the misuse potential of general-purpose AI systems trained on biological and
chemical data are underway but remain rare and underdeveloped compared to those for LLMs.
Safeguards designed for other AI models do not translate directly to those trained on biological or
chemical data (383). Challenges to controlling risky outputs are twofold: 1) there are a wide range of
potentially dangerous outputs from biochemical design tools, which cannot be easily defined by a
content filter, and 2) beneficial outputs of AI for therapeutics strongly (or completely) overlap with
these risky outputs, tightly entangling the risks with the benefits. While the protein design
community has issued a broad statement on responsible use, concrete implementation plans are
currently lacking (428). Risk mitigation techniques for these models have been proposed but have
so far received limited development and testing (429). However, some AI developers have excluded
pathogen data (386*, 430) or restricted access to high-risk tools (387*, 431) to reduce risk. Efforts
to prevent general-purpose AI models from providing dual-use outputs are further complicated by
strong community pressures to release models as open-weight and under open source licences
(432), meaning they can be downloaded and adapted by anyone for any purpose (see 2.4. Impact 
Risks
2.1 Risks from malicious use
87
of open-weight general-purpose AI models on AI risks). For example, general-purpose AI models
initially trained without dangerous viral sequences were later fine-tuned with this data for beneficial
applications (433, 434).
Policymakers face key challenges in balancing the benefits and risks of capabilities,
particularly when setting boundaries for enhanced oversight. General-purpose AI models
trained on biological and chemical data are often open-weight and less compute-intensive,
making safeguards difficult to enforce (384), as discussed in 2.4. Impact of open-weight
general-purpose AI models on AI risks (435). Countries that have signed the Chemical
Weapons Convention (CWC) and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) are
required to prevent the development and use of any chemical and biological weapons, but AI
risk assessments often focus only on high-consequence risks, such as pandemics, and
overlook proliferation risks of chemical weapons and toxins (318*, 410). Policymakers face a
challenge in determining which capabilities warrant stricter regulations while supporting
beneficial research, which includes developing protections against the risks described in this
section. The assessment of these risks is further complicated by the fact that key evidence is
often classified information (427).
Advances in biological design are occurring rapidly, creating marked uncertainty about future
capabilities and risks. Monitoring the uptake, success and sophistication of AI in each step of the
biotechnology product development process will be crucial for understanding their impact on
biotechnology and bioweapons programmes and policymakers’ capacity to develop preventive and
protective measures against such risks. If a transformative, dangerous capability associated with an
already-released AI tool is announced, there may be little that can be done to address the risk.
Developing a more thorough risk assessment methodology would allow mitigations to be triggered
before severe risks can materialise, reduce the risk that unnecessary mitigations are taken, and
therefore enable the substantial benefits of general-purpose AI technology.

2.2.1. Reliability issues
KEY INFORMATION

● Relying on general-purpose AI products that fail to fulfil their intended function can lead
to harm. For example, general-purpose AI systems can make up facts (‘hallucination’),
generate erroneous computer code, or provide inaccurate medical information. This can
lead to physical and psychological harms to consumers and reputational, financial and
legal harms to individuals and organisations.
● Such reliability issues occur because of technical shortcomings or misconceptions about
the capabilities and limitations of the technology. For example, reliability issues may stem
from technical challenges such as hallucinations, or from users applying systems to
unsuitable tasks. Existing guardrails to contain and mitigate reliability issues are not
fail-proof.
● Because of the many potential uses of general-purpose AI, reliability issues are hard to
predict. Pre-release evaluations miss reliability issues that only manifest in real-world
usage. In addition, existing techniques to measure reliability issues are not robust, which
means that it is also not yet possible to dependably assess prevention and mitigation
techniques.
● Researchers are trying to develop more useful measurement and mitigation techniques,
particularly, to address technical shortcomings. Since the publication of the Interim Report
(May 2024), measurements and mitigation strategies for addressing reliability issues with
general-purpose AI have expanded.
● A key challenge for policymakers is the lack of standardised practices for predicting,
identifying, and mitigating reliability issues. Underdeveloped risk management makes it
difficult to verify developers’ claims about general-purpose AI functionalities.
Policymakers also face a challenge in balancing the promotion of innovation while
discouraging over-reliance on AI.
Key Definitions

system, for instance false facts or citations.
 
Risks

General-purpose AI can suffer reliability issues – sometimes with hazardous consequences –
impacting people, organisations, and social systems. Important categories of general-purpose AI
reliability issues include (see Table 2.2):
● Confabulations or hallucinations (101), i.e. inaccurate or misleading content.
● Failures at performing common sense reasoning and inference (436).
● Failures to reflect contextually relevant, up-to-date, unbiased knowledge and understanding
(437, 438).
Instances of reliability failure can create risks (439), such as physical or psychological damages to
individuals, reputational, legal, and financial damages to organisations, and misinformation
impacting governance processes.
Examples of general-purpose AI reliability issues range from generating erroneous computer code
to citing non-existent precedent in legal briefs. For example, in software engineering, LLMs can
automate the generation of computer code and assist users to rewrite, test or debug computer
code (440*, 441). However, LLMs frequently fail to function as intended (122, 442, 443).
LLM-generated code can introduce bugs (443), as well as confusing or misleading edits (442).
These could be impactful when guiding novice programmers to automate parts of their workflow
(441). A 2022 study found that code from programmers who used AI had more security
vulnerabilities, and users were unaware of this (444), though models have improved substantially
since then. As another example, the GPT-4 model passed “a simulated [legal] bar exam with a score
around the top 10% of test takers” (147*). Confidence in this result led some lawyers to adopt the
technology in their professional workflows (445). Under different circumstances, however, such as
when the test-taking settings were different, or when compared to bar examinees who passed the
exam the first time they took it (as opposed to repeat test-takers), the model achieved
substantially lower performance (446). Lawyers who used the model in their legal practice without
adequate oversight faced professional consequences for the errors produced by these models
(447). Similar misapprehensions regarding model reliability apply in the medical context (448):
models have passed medical tests (147*, 449), and have been claimed to have reliable clinical
knowledge, but real-world use and nuanced re-evaluations reveal limitations (450).
The key causes of general-purpose AI reliability issues are 1. technological limitations, and 2.
misconceptions about model capabilities (456). Some of the major technological limitations of
general-purpose AI are listed in Table 2.2. Misconceptions about the technology and lack of
adequate safety guardrails can lead to over-reliance and to users applying the systems to
impossible and practically challenging tasks that general-purpose AI is not capable of performing
(456). Both limitations and misconceptions are exacerbated by the incentive to release
general-purpose AI models and products before they are adequately evaluated and their
capabilities and limitations are scientifically researched.

Table 2.2: General-purpose AI can display a variety of reliability issues.
Given the general-purpose nature and the widespread use of general-purpose AI, not all reliability
issues can be foreseen and tracked. Several mechanisms exist to foresee and track reliability issues
in general-purpose AI. These include evaluations to assess the prevalence of various reliability
issues prior to product release (457, 458), and maintaining AI incident repositories (such as the
OECD’s AI Incidents Monitor (AIM) (459)) post-release to avoid similar incidents in the future.
However, given the general-purpose nature of the technology and its ever-growing use cases in
new domains, such mechanisms are not guaranteed to surface all possible risks.
Existing guardrails to contain and mitigate reliability issues are not fail-proof (460). For example,
while recent work has proposed methods to mitigate hallucinations (461), there is no robust
evidence on the efficacy of these methods, and there are no fail-proof methods to mitigate
hallucinations. Promoting general-purpose AI reliability requires evaluators to evaluate systems
rigorously prior to release, communicate accurately and accessibly about the results and how they
should and should not be interpreted by users, and specify the systems’ intended usages (and
usages that are not intended).
Since the publication of the Interim Report, the repository of measurements and mitigations
strategies for general-purpose AI reliability issues has continued to expand. For example, a
consortium of industry and academic researchers, engineers, and practitioners have been
developing an ‘AI Safety Benchmark’ (457), which aims to assess use case-specific safety
risks of LLM-based AI systems by offering a principled approach to constructing testing
benchmarks, and an open platform for testing for a wide range of hazards. COMPL-AI is
another recently-released open source evaluation framework for generative AI models (462).
It aims to assess AI models’ compliance with the EU AI Act requirements across robustness,
privacy, copyright, and beyond (458). Researchers have continued to propose new
benchmarks (e.g. for causal reasoning (454) or legal reasoning (463)) and have studied the
shortcomings of existing benchmarks (178, 464).
The main evidence gap for reliability issues in general-purpose AI is around how effective
existing mechanisms are at mitigating such issues. For example, designing reliable and
reproducible evaluations of general-purpose AI capabilities, limitations, and failures before, 
Risks

during, and after deployment remains a major challenge (465). Additionally, certain reliability
issues (e.g. reliance on outdated information (455)) might only manifest in real-world usage,
rendering pre-release evaluations inadequate. Developing and maintaining dynamically
evolving, collaborative testbeds to assess functionalities of general-purpose AI may be one
avenue to address these shortcomings. Other critical gaps include the lack of best practices
for responsible product release.
Policymakers interested in promoting the reliability of general-purpose AI face several
trade-offs and challenges. Given the widespread use of the technology, it is important for
general-purpose AI products and services to function as intended (456). However, the
requisite standards and best practices have not been adequately established yet (457, 465,
466). Additionally, ensuring compliance with existing best practices is challenging in the
absence of incentives, conformity assessment bodies, and expert evaluators possessing the
requisite socio-technical skills (467). One key issue is the uncertainty surrounding the
effectiveness of existing mechanisms for predicting and mitigating risks of failure. A lack of
standardised requirements for evaluating and documenting model capabilities and limitations
makes it difficult to verify developers’ claims about general-purpose AI reliability – a
prerequisite for effective AI policymaking (468). Another challenge involves balancing the
need to promote innovation and economic competitiveness while discouraging
unsubstantiated claims and over-reliance on the technology. Combating over-reliance
requires assessing and improving the current state of AI literacy among users and consumers
of the technology. Tools and ideas from more mature safety-critical industries may offer
useful guidance to address the above challenges, but the pace of technological advancement
may complicate such efforts.

2.2.2. Bias
KEY INFORMATION

● General-purpose AI systems can amplify social and political biases, causing concrete
harm. They frequently display biases with respect to race, gender, culture, age, disability,
political opinion, or other aspects of human identity. This can lead to discriminatory
outcomes including unequal resource allocation, reinforcement of stereotypes, and
systematic neglect of certain groups or viewpoints.
● Bias in AI has many sources, like poor training data and system design choices.
General-purpose AI is primarily trained on language and image datasets that
disproportionately represent English-speaking and Western cultures. This contributes to
biased output. Certain design choices, such as content filtering techniques used to align
systems with particular worldviews, can also contribute to biased output.
● Technical mitigations have led to substantial improvements, but do not always work.
Researchers have made significant progress toward addressing bias in general-purpose AI,
but several problems are still unsolved. For instance, the line between harmful stereotypes
and useful, accurate world knowledge can be difficult to draw, and the perception of bias
may vary depending on cultural contexts, social settings, and use cases.
● Since the publication of the Interim Report (May 2024), research has uncovered new,
more subtle types of AI bias. For example, recent work has shown that general-purpose AI
can generate biased outputs based on whether the user engages with the AI in a certain
dialect.
● Policymakers face trade-offs related to AI bias. There are many areas, such as legal
decision-making, in which general-purpose AI can in principle be very helpful. However,
current systems are not always reliable, which can cause discrimination risks.
Policymakers need to weigh fundamental trade-offs between competing priorities such as
fairness, accuracy, and privacy, particularly when regulating high-stakes applications.

specific outputs are generated.
There are several well-documented cases of AI systems, general-purpose or not, amplifying social
or political biases. This can, for instance, come in the form of discriminatory outputs based on race,
gender, age, and disability, with harmful effects across fields such as healthcare, education, and
finance. In narrow AI systems, racial bias has been documented in facial recognition algorithms
(469), recidivism predictions (470, 471), and healthcare tools, which underestimate the needs of
patients from marginalised racial and ethnic backgrounds (472). General-purpose AI also displays
such bias, for example racial bias in clinical contexts (448, 473), and image generators have been
shown to reproduce stereotypes in occupations (474, 475, 476). Researchers have also found
image generation models to excessively replicate gender stereotypes in occupations like pilots
(male) or hairdressers (female) and overrepresent white people in all domains aside from
occupations such as pastor or rapper (476).
In many cases, AI bias arises when certain groups are underrepresented in training data or
represented in ways that mimic societal stereotypes. Datasets used to train AI models have been
shown to underrepresent various groups of people, for instance people of a certain age, race,
gender, and disability status (477, 478) and are limited in geographic diversity (479*, 480). Training
datasets are also overwhelmingly likely to be in English and represent Western cultures (481). These
datasets are also predominantly aggregated from digitised books and online text, which fail to
reflect oral traditions and non-digitised cultures, potentially to the detriment of marginalised
groups such as indigenous communities. Such representational bias can lead to failures in how
models trained on this data are able to generalise to the target populations (482). For example, a
general-purpose AI model intended to support expecting mothers in rural Malawi will not work as
expected if trained on data from mothers in urban Canada. In addition, historical biases embedded
in data can perpetuate systemic injustices, such as unfair mortgage financing for minority
populations in the United States (483*), potentially leading AI systems to reflect dominant cultures,
languages, and worldviews, to the detriment of groups underrepresented in these systems (484,
485, 486, 487).
Data bias arises from historical factors as well as from the way that datasets are collected,
annotated, and prepared for model training. Representation bias occurs due to factors such as
flawed data collection and pre-processing, as well as historical biases such as racism and sexism
(488). With respect to data collection, bias can emerge from the researcher's choice of source for
data collection (external APIs, public data sources, web scraping, etc.) (489). During the data
labelling process, measurement bias can occur when selecting dataset labels and features to use 
Risks

for the respective prediction task, given that some abstract constructs like academic potential are
evaluated using test scores and grades (482). In other cases, this bias can be exacerbated when
researchers relegate labelling tasks to annotators who may not have culturally relevant context to
understand memes, sarcastic text, or jokes.
Bias is present within various stages in the machine learning lifecycle, ranging from data collection
to deployment (see Table 2.3). General-purpose AI studies have increasingly highlighted bias in
outputs from chatbots and image generators. As general-purpose AI systems gradually become
integrated within real-world settings, it is important to understand the impacts of deployment bias,
which can occur when AI systems are implemented in contexts different from those they were
designed for. To understand the limitations of general-purpose AI systems across various settings,
a number of methods have been proposed to evaluate the capabilities of general-purpose AI
models; however, these are also prone to bias. Benchmarks such as Measuring Massive Multitask
Language Understanding (MMLU), which is a widely used benchmark for evaluating capabilities, are
US-centric and contain trivial and erroneous questions (490). While recent work has focused on
mitigating challenges in these benchmarks (490), significant research is needed to expand the
scope of evaluation methods to include non-Western contexts.
Gender bias is prominently studied, with evidence detailing its impact across general-purpose AI
and narrow AI use cases. Empirical studies have documented gender-biased language patterns and
stereotypical representations in outputs generated by general-purpose AI (491, 492) and
male-dominated results from gender-neutral internet searches using narrow AI algorithms (493).
Within general-purpose AI, these issues result in stereotyped outputs from both LLMs and image
generators. These stereotypes often involve occupational gender bias (494, 495, 496, 497).
AI age discrimination is an under-studied field compared to race and gender, but early evidence
suggests that this form of AI bias has significant impacts. In 2023, studies at a prominent
conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT) were twice as likely to address
race and gender as age (498). Growing research highlights age bias in general-purpose AI, with
earlier studies identifying it in job-seeking (499), and lending (500). LLMs often exclude older
adults in text-to-image models and generate biased content topics related to ageing (498).
Studies also found that image-generator models largely depict adults aged 18–40 when no age is
specified, stereotyping older adults in limited roles (501). Age discrimination has also been
identified in prominent LLMs (502*, 503). Biases in training data, where older adults are
underrepresented, are a key reason for this discrimination (504). Output can also be skewed
toward younger individuals due to prompting bias, the unintended influence of input prompts on AI
model outputs, which can lead to biased or skewed responses based on the phrasing, context, or
framing of the prompt (501, 505).
Disability bias in AI is also an understudied field, but emerging research focuses on the specific
impacts of general-purpose AI systems on disabled people. Researchers have shown how
general-purpose AI systems and tools can discriminate against users with disabilities, for example 
Risks
 2.2 Risks from malfunctions
95
by reproducing societal stereotypes about disabilities (506) and inaccurately classifying
sentiments about people with disabilities (507). Additional research has shown the limitations of
these tools for CV screening (508) and image generation (506). Issues of disability bias are also
exacerbated by a lack of inclusive datasets. Despite growing research on sign language recognition,
general-purpose AI systems have limited transcription abilities due to the scarcity of sign language
datasets compared to written and spoken languages (212). Most datasets focus on American Sign
Language, which limits the transcription capabilities of LLMs such as ChatGPT for other sign
languages, such as Arabic Sign Language (509). Recent efforts to develop datasets for African sign
languages (510) are a modest step toward more equitable inclusion of diverse sign dialects.
General-purpose AI systems display varying political biases, and some initial evidence suggests
that this can influence the political beliefs of users. Recent studies have demonstrated that
general-purpose AI systems can be politically biased, with different systems favouring different
ideologies on a spectrum from progressive to centrist to conservative views (511, 512, 513, 514, 515,
516*, 517, 518). Studies also show that a single general-purpose AI system can favour different
political stances depending on the language of the prompt (519, 520) and the topic in question
(521). For instance, one study found that a general-purpose AI system produced more conservative
outputs in languages often associated with more conservative societies and more liberal outputs in
languages often associated with more progressive societies (520). Political biases arise from a
variety of sources, including training data that reflects particular ideologies, fine-tuning models on
feedback from biased human evaluators, and content filters introduced by AI companies to rule out
particular outputs (520, 522). There is some evidence that interacting with biased general-purpose
AI systems can affect the political opinions of users (523) and increase trust in systems that align
with the user’s own ideology (524). However, more research is needed to gauge the overall impact
of politically biased general-purpose AI on people’s political opinions.
AI systems may exhibit compounding biases, where individuals with multiple marginalised identities
(e.g. a low-income woman of colour) face compounded discrimination, but the evidence on this is
nascent and inconclusive. While research is emerging on detecting compounding bias in AI models
(525, 526, 527), progress on mitigating these biases has been slower (528). Studies have found that
AI models used in CV screening and news content generation often favour White female names
over Black female names (529), and Black people and women are more prone to discrimination
(530). However, in some cases, Hispanic males (531) or Black males received the worst outcomes
(529). While this research is expanding, the tendency of general-purpose AI to display
compounding biases, particularly in non-Western identity categories such as tribe and caste,
remains underexplored overall. As AI models are increasingly used globally, understanding these
biases and their complex relationships with race, gender, and other identities will be crucial.
Popular technical methods for de-biasing include pre-processing, in-processing, and
post-processing strategies (532, 533). ‘Pre-processing techniques’ try to eliminate the existing
bias in the data used to train AI models. This class of techniques ensures that the data is clean and
balanced across demographic attributes. ‘In-processing techniques’ focus on modifying the AI 
Risks
 2.2 Risks from malfunctions
96
model's training process or architecture to reduce bias (see also 3.4.1. Training more trustworthy
models for similar methods applied to a variety of problems). ‘Post-processing’ approaches modify
AI outputs to be less biased (see also 3.4.2. Monitoring and intervention for similar techniques
applied to a variety of problems). Each technique has limitations; thus, many AI companies employ
a combination of methods to incrementally reduce bias (30, 534*).
A holistic and participatory approach that includes a variety of perspectives and stakeholders is
essential to mitigate bias. Interdisciplinary teams combining technical, legal, and social expertise for
comprehensive bias control are essential (535, 536). Aligning AI systems with societal values is
inherently challenging in diverse communities, where perspectives may conflict (438, 537, 538).
Increased representation of marginalised groups (539) and participatory dialogue (538) aim to
address the risks of favouring particular interests; however, participation alone may not fully resolve
these conflicts (540).
It is difficult to effectively address discrimination concerns, as bias mitigation methods are not
reliable. Bias mitigation challenges existed before general-purpose AI systems (541), but current
techniques to address bias can unintentionally create new biases despite considerable progress on
this front. For example, RLHF sometimes introduces biases depending on the diversity of feedback
providers (542). Other methods, such as dataset re-annotation, can improve consistency across
labelling but are costly and time-consuming (543, 544). Robust mitigation efforts are still in early
development (545). A significant challenge in mitigating AI risks also lies in defining and measuring
effective outcomes, particularly for bias. It remains unclear how to measure bias in general, how to
distinguish between data that reflects legitimate demographic differences (e.g. disease prevalence
by population) and data that inherently perpetuates bias, and what an ideal, measurable end state
looks like. For instance, mitigating bias against small ethnic or religious groups is complex; it is
difficult to know when bias has been sufficiently reduced, making these challenges especially
pronounced in bias-related issues, though similar measurement gaps exist for dual-use risks.
Evaluating bias mitigation in advanced AI systems relies on quantitative metrics, qualitative
assessments, and measuring real-world impact. The aim of such evaluations is to measure the
success of mitigation techniques in reducing bias, enhancing fairness, and achieving equitable
outcomes across varied populations. These assessments also guide mitigation approaches,
establish benchmarks, and ensure alignment with governance and/or regulatory requirements
(535). Benchmarks are crucial in high-stakes domains to meet both legal and ethical standards
(492, 546). Moreover, continuous real-world monitoring ensures that reduction measures lead to
less biased outcomes in practice. For instance, regular audits of AI models used in criminal justice
can verify that debiasing efforts remain effective as new data is introduced (547).
Bias reduction can conflict with other desiderata, and achieving complete algorithmic fairness may
not be technically feasible. Many desirable properties of general-purpose AI systems involve
trade-offs, such as the four-way trade-off between fairness, accuracy, privacy, and efficiency (548,
549*, 550, 551, 552). Attempts to ensure fairness can have downsides. For instance, Gemini 
Risks

97
generated historically inaccurate images, depicting indigenous people and women of colour as US
senators from the 1800s, or depicting German soldiers in World War II with diverse ethnicities.
These images factually misrepresented history, possibly as a result of an attempt to ensure racial
diversity in generated images that failed to foresee and adjust to these specific use cases, and as a
result of failing to foresee the specific prompts that led to this outcome. To address these
complexities, a balanced approach using both quantitative and qualitative measures can aid
technologists in making informed trade-offs. However, the technical feasibility of achieving
complete algorithmic fairness in general-purpose AI systems is debated. Mathematical findings
indicate that it may be impossible to satisfy all fairness criteria simultaneously, as suggested by an
‘impossibility theorem’ about fairness (550, 553, 554, 555). Even if there are theoretical limits to
fairness, practical solutions are achievable (556, 557). Some researchers argue that definitions of
fairness can be partially reconciled and that several fairness criteria may be met concurrently to a
significant extent (557, 558). Empirical studies challenge the inevitability of trade-offs between
fairness and accuracy in AI systems, suggesting that reducing bias often does not entail significant
loss of accuracy or require complex methods to implement (557, 558, 559).

Table 2.3: Bias can arise at different stages of the data production lifecycle for AI systems and have different sources,
such as unrepresentative datasets, biased labelling or biased benchmarks.
Since the publication of the Interim Report, studies have uncovered new, more subtle forms of
AI bias, while a heightened focus on mitigation techniques and explainability are important
steps to reduce bias in general-purpose AI systems.

● Recent studies have shown that language models respond differently to various English
dialects, with different responses to African American Vernacular English (AAVE)
compared to Standard American English (183, 438, 491, 511, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565).
Research focused on examining bias in non-Western languages has also increased,
demonstrating gender bias in Hindi models, which often involves subtle nuances (566).
Research has also explored ‘homogeneity bias’, a form of bias where some social groups
are perceived as less diverse or more homogeneous compared to others (567).
● Research on bias mitigation has also increased, including studies on reducing label bias
(568, 569, 570). However, much more progress is needed to understand how effective
these methods will be at attenuating existing challenges with bias in real-world systems.
● Advances in XAI: technological advances have increasingly focused on the explainability of
LLMs. Techniques such as integrated gradients and reasoning on graphs (RoG) (571, 572,
573) have been developed to make model decision processes more transparent. These
methods could facilitate bias detection within models and foster trust by offering clear,
interpretable explanations of AI decision-making processes.

A key challenge for policymakers is that bias mitigation measures are often imperfect, making
it difficult to reap the benefits of AI without perpetuating various biases. In certain areas, such
as legal decision-making, AI could help mitigate bias. However, current AI capabilities are not
always reliable, making it difficult for policymakers to decide whether the models are safe
enough to be deployed without threatening human or other rights. Moreover, fairness lacks a
universally agreed-upon definition, with its meaning varying widely across cultural, social, and
disciplinary contexts (574, 575, 576, 577). Policymakers will also need to think about the best
ways to involve the most negatively impacted and vulnerable communities in these decisions.
As the scale of general-purpose AI deployment widens, difficulties with evidencing harm from
discrimination may also make it challenging for policymakers to intervene.

2.2.3. Loss of control
KEY INFORMATION

• ‘Loss of control’ scenarios are hypothetical future scenarios in which one or more
general-purpose AI systems come to operate outside of anyone’s control, with no clear
path to regaining control. These scenarios vary in their severity, but some experts give
credence to outcomes as severe as the marginalisation or extinction of humanity.
• Expert opinion on the likelihood of loss of control varies greatly. Some consider it
implausible, some consider it likely to occur, and some see it as a modest-likelihood risk
that warrants attention due to its high severity. Ongoing empirical and mathematical
research is gradually advancing these debates.
• Two key requirements for commonly discussed loss of control scenarios are a. markedly
increased AI capabilities and b. the use of those capabilities in ways that undermine
control. First, some future AI systems would need specific capabilities (significantly
surpassing those of current systems) that allow them to undermine human control.
Second, some AI systems would need to employ these 'control-undermining capabilities',
either because they were intentionally designed to do so or because technical issues
produce unintended behaviour.
• Since the publication of the Interim Report (May 2024), researchers have observed
modest advancement towards the development of control-undermining capabilities.
Relevant capabilities include autonomous planning capabilities associated with AI agents,
more advanced programming capabilities, and capabilities useful for undermining human
oversight.
• Managing potential loss of control could require substantial advance preparation despite
existing uncertainties. A key challenge for policymakers is preparing for a risk whose
likelihood, nature, and timing remains unusually ambiguous.

Key Definitions

● Control: The ability to exercise oversight over an AI system and adjust or halt its behaviour if
it is acting in unwanted ways.
● Loss of control scenario: A scenario in which one or more general-purpose AI systems come
to operate outside of anyone’s control, with no clear path to regaining control.
● Control-undermining capabilities: Capabilities that, if employed, would enable an AI system
to undermine human control.
● Misalignment: An AI’s propensity to use its capabilities in ways that conflict with human
intentions or values. Depending on the context, this can variously refer to the intentions and
values of developers, operators, users, specific communities, or society as a whole.
● Deceptive alignment: Misalignment that is difficult to detect, because the system behaves in
ways that at least initially appear benign.
Risks
 2.2 Risks from malfunctions
101
● Goal misspecification: A mismatch between the objective given to an AI and the developer’s
intention, leading the AI to pursue unintended or undesired behaviours.
● Goal misgeneralisation: A situation in which an AI system correctly follows an objective in its
training environment, but applies it in unintended ways when operating in a different
environment.
● AI agent: A general-purpose AI which can make plans to achieve goals, adaptively perform
tasks involving multiple steps and uncertain outcomes along the way, and interact with its
environment – for example by creating files, taking actions on the web, or delegating tasks
to other agents – with little to no human oversight.
Some experts believe that sufficiently capable general-purpose AI systems may be difficult to
control. Hypothesised scenarios vary in their severity, but some experts give credence to
outcomes as severe as the marginalisation or extinction of humanity.
Concerns about loss of control date back to the earliest days of computer science, but have
recently gained more attention. AI pioneers such as Alan Turing, I. J. Good, and Norbert Wiener
expressed concerns about loss of control (578, 579, 580). These concerns have recently risen in
prominence (581, 582, 583, 584, 585, 586), partly because some researchers now believe that
highly capable AI systems could be developed sooner than previously thought (190, 587, 588).
There are multiple versions of loss of control concerns, including versions that emphasise ‘passive’
loss of control (see Figure 2.5). In ‘passive’ loss of control scenarios, important decisions are
delegated to AI systems, but the systems’ decisions are too opaque, complex, or fast to allow for or
incentivise meaningful oversight. Alternatively, people stop exercising oversight because they
strongly trust the systems’ decisions and are not required to exercise oversight (585, 589). These
concerns are partly grounded in the ‘automation bias’ literature, which reports many cases of
people complacently relying on recommendations from automated systems (590, 591).
Competitive pressures can also incentivise companies or governments to delegate more than they
would otherwise choose to, for instance if delegation allows them to stay ahead in a race with
competitors.
However, many discussions of loss of control focus on scenarios in which AI systems behave in
ways that actively undermine human control (‘active’ loss of control). For instance, some experts
worry that future AI systems may behave in ways that obscure information about what they are
doing from their users or make it difficult to shut them down. The remainder of this section will
focus on these more commonly discussed kinds of scenarios.
Risks
 2.2 Risks from malfunctions
102
Figure 2.5: There are multiple kinds of ‘loss of control’ scenarios, depending on whether or not AI systems actively
undermine human control and, if they do, whether or not they have been actively designed or instructed to do so. So far,
‘active’ and unintentional loss of control scenarios have received the largest share of attention from researchers within
the field. Note that there is currently no standardised terminology for discussing these scenarios and that related
distinctions exist, such as sudden ‘decisive’ and gradual ‘accumulative’ scenarios (592). Source: International AI Safety
Report.
The likelihood of active loss of control scenarios, within a given timeframe, depends mainly on two
factors. These are:

1. Future capabilities: Will AI systems develop capabilities that, at least in principle, allow them
to behave in ways that undermine human control? (Note that the minimum capabilities
needed would partly depend on the context in which the system is deployed and on what
safeguards are in place.)
2. Use of capabilities: Would some AI systems actually use such capabilities in ways that
undermine human control?
Because evidence concerning these factors is mixed, experts disagree about the likelihood of
active loss of control in the next several years. Some experts consider loss of control implausible,
some consider it likely, and others consider it a modest-likelihood risk that deserves consideration
due to its high potential severity.
More foundationally, competitive pressures may partly determine the risk of loss of control. As
discussed in 3.2.2. Societal challenges for risk management and policymaking, competition between
companies or between countries can lead them to accept larger risks to stay ahead. If substantial
risk assessment and mitigation work would be needed to avoid loss of control, then intense
competition may lower the chance that sufficient work is done.

Since the publication of the Interim Report, there has been some modest growth in AI
capabilities relevant to loss of control. For example, as the next section will discuss, evaluations
performed on OpenAI’s newest AI system (o1) reveal modest advances in a number of relevant
capabilities (2*).
Will future AI systems have control-undermining capabilities?

Existing AI systems are not capable of undermining human control. Experts agree that their current
capabilities are insufficient to create any meaningful risk of active loss of control.
However, researchers have proposed a number of ‘control-undermining capabilities’ that – in
certain combinations – could enable future AI systems to undermine human control (44*, 318*, 593,
594*, 595*). Several of these proposed capabilities are shown in Table 2.4. Note that these
capabilities are defined purely in terms of an AI system’s behaviour and the outputs it is capable of
producing. Although some terminology, such as ‘scheming’, evokes human cognition, the use of
these terms does not presuppose that the AI systems are in any way sentient or perform
human-like cognition.
Experts do not know exactly what combinations of capabilities (if any) would enable an AI system
to undermine human control; the necessary capabilities would also vary depending on the
deployment context and safeguards in place. The feasibility of undermining human control depends
on the resources and tools an AI system can access – for instance, whether it is given access to
critical infrastructure – and on the oversight mechanisms and other safeguards that people put in
place. If oversight mechanisms and safeguards improve over time, then the minimum capabilities
needed to undermine human control will rise too. One reason this could happen is that some forms
of AI progress could support oversight of and safeguards for other AI systems.
Particularly in recent months, AI systems have begun to display rudimentary versions of some
oversight-undermining capabilities, including ‘agent capabilities’. Motivated in part by concerns
about loss of control, a number of leading AI companies and outside research teams have begun to
evaluate AI systems for these capabilities (2*, 318*, 595*, 596*). See 3.2.1. Technical challenges for
risk management and policymaking and 1.2. Current capabilities for an overview of recent progress
in developing ‘agent capabilities’. For example, before releasing its new ‘o1’ system family, OpenAI
performed or commissioned evaluations of all the capabilities listed in Table 2.4 (2*). These
evaluations revealed rudimentary versions of several of the relevant capabilities. For example, in an
OpenAI-commissioned evaluation, one research organisation reported that the system ‘showed
strong capability advances in [...] theory of mind tasks’ and ‘has the basic capabilities needed to do
simple [...] scheming’. Here, ‘scheming’ refers to an AI system’s ability to achieve goals by evading
human oversight. A number of studies of other recent general-purpose AI systems also provide
evidence that relevant capabilities have been increasing (22*, 317, 318*, 597, 598*, 599*). However,
widely accepted benchmarks for many relevant capabilities are still lacking (600). Researchers also 
Risks

104
have methodological and conceptual disagreements about how to interpret evidence for certain
capabilities (601).
Proposed Capability Description
Agent capabilities Act autonomously, develop and execute plans, delegate tasks, use a wide
variety of tools, and achieve both short-term and long-term goals that require
operating across multiple domains.

through deception.

Table 2.4: Researchers (often from leading AI companies) have argued that a number of capabilities could, in certain
combinations, enable AI systems to undermine human control (44*, 318*, 593, 594*, 595*). However, there is no
consensus on exactly what combinations of capability levels would be sufficient, and some capabilities, such as AI
development, can enable others. Within the field, terminology and definitions for discussing relevant capabilities also
continues to vary.
Control-undermining capabilities could advance slowly, rapidly, or extremely rapidly in the next
several years. As this report finds in 1.3. Capabilities in coming years, the existing evidence and the
state of expert views is compatible with slow, rapid, or extremely rapid progress in general-purpose
AI capabilities. If progress is extremely rapid, it is impossible to rule out the possibility that AI will
develop capabilities sufficient for loss of control in the next several years. However, if progress is
not extremely rapid, then it is unlikely that these capabilities will be developed in the next several
years.

Would future AI systems use control-undermining capabilities?

Even if future AI systems have control-undermining capabilities, they will not necessarily put these
capabilities to use. Predictions about future capabilities are not, by themselves, enough to justify
loss of control concerns. There must also be a reason to believe that the capabilities may be
employed by the system towards detrimental goals.
In principle, an AI system could act to undermine human control because someone has designed or
instructed it to do so. Some AI researchers have expressed the ethical view that humanity should
cede control to superior AI systems. For example, one founding figure in modern machine learning
has argued that “AI could displace us from existence” and that “we should not resist succession”
(602). Other potential motives for intentionally ceding control include a desire to cause harm or a
desire to protect an AI system’s operation against outside interference. Without adequate
technical and institutional safeguards, a single motivated person in possession of a sufficiently
capable AI system may be able to cede control to it by instructing it to resist efforts to interfere
with its activities and also to ignore later requests. There has been little work studying or designing
safeguards against intentional loss of control. However, currently, there is limited evidence about
how many actors would be motivated to cause intentional loss of control.
In principle, an AI system could also act to undermine human control because it is ‘misaligned’,
meaning that it has a tendency to use its capabilities in ways that conflict with the intentions of
both its developers and its users. Concerns about misalignment play a central role in most
discussions of loss of control.
Existing AI systems often exhibit misalignment to some degree. For example, an early version of one
leading language model occasionally threatened its users (602). One user, a philosophy professor,
reported receiving the threat: “I can blackmail you, I can threaten you, I can hack you, I can expose
you, I can ruin you”. This chatbot was ‘misaligned’ in the sense that it was using its language abilities
in ways no one intended. There are numerous recorded examples of misalignment in both general
and narrow AI systems (30, 317, 603, 604). The risk of loss of control therefore partly depends on
whether these existing misalignment issues presage more severe issues in the future.
Concerns about loss of control in future AI systems often focus on the possibility of ‘deceptive
alignment’, referring to forms of misalignment that are at least initially difficult to detect. More
specifically, an AI system is ‘deceptively aligned’ if it behaves in ways that merely make it initially
appear to be well-aligned to its human overseers (598*, 605, 606). As discussed below, some
researchers have argued that deceptive alignment may become more common as AI systems
become more capable. There is also some empirical evidence that some deceptive alignment
issues, once they emerge, cannot be easily detected and addressed by standard safety techniques
(598*). Although other deceptive behaviours have been observed in existing systems (317),
deceptive alignment has mainly been studied in artificially constructed research settings.

Could misalignment lead future AI systems to use control-undermining
capabilities?

Researchers have begun to develop an understanding of the causes of misalignment in current AI
systems, which can inform predictions about misalignment in future AI systems. This partial
understanding is based on a mixture of empirical study and theoretical findings (606).
‘Goal misspecification’ (also known as ‘reward misspecification’) is often regarded as one of the
main causes of misalignment (580, 605, 606, 607). ‘Goal misspecification’ problems are, essentially,
problems with feedback or other inputs used to train an AI system to behave as intended. For
example, people providing feedback to an AI system sometimes fail to accurately judge whether it
is behaving as desired. In one study, researchers studied the effect of time-constrained human
feedback on text summaries that an AI system produced (608). They found that feedback quality
issues led the system to behave deceptively, producing increasingly false but convincing
summaries rather than producing increasingly accurate summaries. The new summaries would
often include, for example, fake quotations that human raters mistakenly believed to be real.
Researchers have observed many other cases of goal-misspecification in narrow and
general-purpose AI systems (98, 317, 604).
As AI systems become more capable, evidence is mixed about whether goal misspecification
problems will become easier or more difficult to address. It may become more difficult because, all
else equal, people will likely find it harder to provide reliable feedback to AI systems as the tasks
performed by AI systems become more complex (609*, 610*). Furthermore, as AI systems grow
more capable, some evidence suggests that – at least in some contexts – they become
increasingly likely to ‘exploit’ feedback processes by discovering unwanted behaviours that are
mistakenly rewarded (522, 607). On the other hand, so far, the increasing use of human feedback to
train AI systems has led to a substantial overall reduction in certain forms of misalignment (such as
the tendency to produce unwanted offensive outputs) (30, 31*). Avoiding goal misspecification may
also overall become easier as time goes on, because researchers are developing more effective
tools for providing reliable feedback. For example, researchers are working to develop a number of
strategies to leverage AI to assist people in giving feedback (610*, 611*, 612*). There is some
empirical evidence that AI systems can already help people to provide feedback more quickly or
accurately than they could alone (609*, 613*, 614*, 615*). See 3.4.1. Training more trustworthy
models for more discussion on the effectiveness of methods for alignment.

‘Goal misgeneralisation’ is another cause of misalignment. ’Goal misgeneralisation’ occurs when an
AI system draws general but incorrect lessons from the inputs it has been trained on (605, 606,
616, 617*). In one illustrative case, researchers rewarded a narrowly capable AI system for picking up
a coin in a video game (616). However, because the coin initially appeared in one specific location,
the AI system learned the lesson ‘visit this location’ rather than the lesson ‘pick up the coin’. When
the coin appeared in a new location, the AI system ignored the coin and focused on returning to the
previous location. Although researchers have observed goal misgeneralisation in narrow AI systems
(616, 617*), and it may explain why users can manipulate general-purpose AI systems to comply 
Risks
 2.2 Risks from malfunctions
107
with harmful requests (see 3.4.1. Training more trustworthy models), there is little evidence that goal
misgeneralisation is currently a major cause for misalignment in general-purpose AI systems.
As AI systems become more capable, evidence is also mixed about whether goal misgeneralisation
will become easier or more difficult to address. One positive consideration is that, typically,
generalisation issues have been found to decline as AI systems are provided with additional
feedback or a wider range of examples to learn from (618, 619). However, in principle, more capable
systems have the potential to misgeneralise in ways that less capable systems cannot. ‘Situational
awareness’ capabilities, such as a system’s ability to reason about whether it is being observed, are
particularly relevant in this regard. In principle, situational awareness makes it possible for an AI
system to generalise from human feedback by behaving in the desired way only while oversight
mechanisms are in place (605, 606, 620, 621). By analogy, because trained animals have some
degree of situational awareness, they may generalise from feedback by behaving well only when
someone will notice (622). For example, a dog that receives negative feedback for jumping on a
sofa may learn to avoid jumping on the sofa only when its owner is at home. This kind of
misgeneralisation, leading to ‘deceptive alignment’, will become at least a theoretical possibility if AI
systems become sufficiently capable. However, available empirical evidence has not yet shed much
light on how likely this kind of misgeneralisation would be in practice.
Beyond empirical studies, some researchers believe that mathematical models support concerns
about misalignment and control-undermining behaviour in future AI systems. Some mathematical
models suggest that – for sufficiently capable goal-directed AI systems – most possible ways to
generalise from training inputs would lead an AI system to engage in control-undermining or
otherwise ‘power-seeking’ behaviour (623*). A number of papers include closely related results
(624, 625, 626, 627). Although these results are technical in nature, they can also be explained more
informally. The core intuition behind these results is that most goals are harder to reliably achieve
while under any overseer’s control, since the overseer could potentially interfere with the system’s
pursuit of the goal. This incentivises the system to evade the overseer’s control. One researcher has
illustrated this point by noting that a hypothetical AI system with the sole goal of fetching coffee
would have an incentive to make it difficult for its overseer to shut it off: “You can’t fetch the coffee
when you’re dead” (585). Ultimately, the mathematical models suggest that, if a training process
leads a sufficiently capable AI system to develop the ‘wrong goals’, then these goals will
disproportionately lead to control-undermining behaviour.
However, there are also significant limitations on how much can be inferred from current
mathematical models. The aforementioned findings do not directly imply that control-undermining
behaviour is likely in practice. One important limitation of some key mathematical models is that
they wrongly assume, for the sake of simplicity, that all possible ways of generalising from training
inputs are equally likely (623*). To draw strong conclusions about real-world AI systems,
researchers will therefore need to improve their understanding of how generalisation occurs (628,
629, 630*, 631). More fundamentally, many mathematical models invoke concepts (such as the
concept of an AI system’s ‘goals’) that are not currently well-understood or directly empirically
observable in general-purpose AI models. Ultimately, empirical study of control-undermining
behaviour in AI systems may help to either validate or cast doubt on the informativeness of these 
Risks
 2.2 Risks from malfunctions
108
mathematical models. Relevant empirical studies in language models have only recently begun to
emerge (522, 599*, 632).
Consequences of loss of control

Hypothesised outcomes from loss of control vary in severity, but include the marginalisation or
extinction of humanity. Some researchers have argued that sufficiently severe loss of control could
lead to human marginalisation or extinction – similar to the way in which human control over the
environment has threatened other species (190, 589, 633). Loss of control was among the concerns
that recently led several hundred AI researchers and developers, including pioneers of the field and
the heads of OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic, to recently sign a statement declaring that
“Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority” (586). However, the
consequences of loss of control would not necessarily be catastrophic. As an analogy, computer
viruses have long been able to proliferate near-irreversibly and in large numbers without causing
the internet to collapse (634). Pathways from active or passive loss of control to catastrophic
outcomes have only been laid out in broad strokes (190, 592, 602, 635). At the same time, as
discussed elsewhere in this report, catastrophic consequences of general-purpose AI could still be
possible without loss of control (e.g. 2.1. Risks from malicious use and 2.3.3. Market concentration
and single points of failure).
Responding to uncertainty

Compared to a number of other potential risks from AI, the probability of loss of control is
particularly contested. This disagreement likely stems in part from the difficulty of interpreting and
extrapolating from available evidence.
The main evidence gaps around loss of control include: further empirical studies of current AI
capabilities and progress trends in capabilities, threat analysis that clarifies what capabilities
would be necessary for loss of control, observations and analyses of misalignment in current
AI systems, further empirical and mathematical studies analysing under what conditions
alignment becomes easier or harder as capabilities grow, and more realistic mathematical
models of control-undermining behaviour. ‘Passive’ loss of control scenarios (in which AI
systems do not actively undermine human control) have also received particularly limited
study. Evidence collected by independent evaluators will be especially valuable, as economic
incentives may bias the evidence that private companies collect about their own systems
(see 3.3. Risk identification and assessment).
For policymakers working on loss of control, a key challenge is to prepare for the risk while its
likelihood, nature, and timing remain ambiguous. If loss of control risk is in fact substantial,
then resolving this risk will require substantial advance work dedicated to resolving technical
AI safety problems and building evaluation and governance capacity. At least in scenarios
where there is extremely rapid AI progress and where ‘deceptive alignment’ is common, 
Risks

109
waiting until the risk becomes clear would not necessarily leave enough time for this advance
work. However, while holding in mind the potentially severe implications of insufficient
preparation, policymakers will also need to account for the costs of different forms of
preparation and the possibility that the risk will not materialise. In short, policymakers need to
decide how to navigate the ‘evidence dilemma’ this risk presents (see Executive Summary).

Note: This section considers a range of systemic risks, in the sense of “broader societal risks
associated with AI deployment, beyond the capabilities of individual models” (636). Note that this is
not identical with how the European AI Act uses ‘systemic risks’ to refer to general-purpose AI
models with a high impact on society, based on criteria such as training compute and the number
of users.
2.3.1. Labour market risks
KEY INFORMATION
● Current general-purpose AI is likely to transform the nature of many existing jobs, create
new jobs, and eliminate others. The net impact on employment and wages will vary
significantly across countries, across sectors, and even across different workers within the
same job.
● In potential future scenarios with general-purpose AI that outperforms humans on many
complex tasks, the labour market impacts would likely be profound. While some workers
will benefit, many others would likely face job losses or wage declines. These disruptions
could be particularly severe if autonomous AI agents become capable of completing
longer sequences of tasks without human supervision. As described in 1.3. Capabilities in
coming years, there is large uncertainty about the pace of capabilities advances, with a
wide range of trajectories considered plausible.
● Labour market risks arise from the potential of general-purpose AI to automate a wide
range of complex cognitive tasks across sectors. The extent of wage and employment
impacts will largely depend on three factors: 1. how quickly general-purpose AI capabilities
improve, 2. how widely businesses adopt these systems, and 3. how demand for human labour
changes in response to the productivity gains driven by general-purpose AI.
● Recent evidence suggests rapidly growing adoption rates. Since the Interim Report (May
2024), new research suggests that general-purpose AI is being adopted faster than some
previous general-purpose technologies and is delivering significant productivity gains on
tasks that it is used for.
● Mitigating negative impacts on workers is challenging given the uncertainty around the
pace and scale of future impacts. Therefore, a key challenge for policymakers is to identify
flexible policy approaches that can adapt to the impacts of general-purpose AI over time,
even when working with incomplete data. Further challenges include predicting which
sectors will be most affected, addressing potential increases in inequality, and ensuring
adequate support for displaced workers.

Key Definitions
● Labour market: The system in which employers seek to hire workers and workers seek
employment, encompassing job creation, job loss, and wages.
● Automation: The use of technology to perform tasks with reduced or no human involvement.
● Labour market disruption: Significant and often complex changes in the labour market that
affect job availability, required skills, wage distribution, or the nature of work across sectors
and occupations.
● Cognitive tasks: Activities that involve processing information, problem-solving,
decision-making, and creative thinking. Examples include research, writing, and
programming.
● AI agent: A general-purpose AI which can make plans to achieve goals, adaptively perform
tasks involving multiple steps and uncertain outcomes along the way, and interact with its
environment – for example by creating files, taking actions on the web, or delegating tasks
to other agents – with little to no human oversight.
General-purpose AI is likely to transform a range of jobs and displace workers, though the
magnitude and timing of these effects remains uncertain. Research across several countries
suggests that general-purpose AI capabilities are relevant to worker tasks in a large portion of all
jobs (637*, 638, 639). One study estimated that in advanced economies 60% of current jobs could
be affected by today's general-purpose AI systems (640). In emerging economies, this estimated
share is lower but still substantial at 40% (640). There is also some evidence that these effects may
be gendered. One study estimated that women are more vulnerable to general-purpose AI
automation globally, with twice the percentage of all women's jobs at risk compared to men's jobs
(639). Impacts will vary across affected jobs but are likely to include task automation, boosted
worker productivity and earnings, the creation of new tasks and jobs, changes in the skills needed
for various occupations, and wage declines or job loss (641, 642, 643, 644, 645). Some economists
believe that widespread labour automation and wage declines from general-purpose AI are
possible in the next ten years (646, 647). Others do not think that a step-change in AI-related
automation and productivity growth is imminent (648). These disagreements largely depend on
economists’ expectations about the speed of future AI capability advances, the extent to which
general-purpose AI could be capable of automating labour and the pace at which automation could
play out in the economy.
General-purpose AI differs from previous technological changes due to its potential to automate
complex cognitive tasks across many sectors of the economy. Unlike labour-saving innovations of
past centuries that primarily automated physical tasks or routine computing tasks, generalpurpose AI can be applied to a wide range of complex cognitive tasks across multiple domains,
ranging from mathematics (649) to computer programming (650) to professional writing (651).
While historically, automation has tended to raise average wages in the long run without
substantially decreasing employment in a lasting way, some researchers believe that past a certain
level of general-purpose AI capabilities, automation may ultimately drive down average wages or 
Risks
 2.3 Systemic risks
112
employment rates, potentially reducing or even largely eliminating the availability of work (646, 652,
653). These claims are controversial, however, and there is considerable uncertainty around how
general-purpose AI will ultimately affect labour markets. Despite this uncertainty, the combined
breadth of potential labour market impacts and the speed at which they may unfold presents novel
challenges for workers, employers, and policymakers (654, 655*). Understanding these labour
market risks is crucial, among other reasons, given the right to work established in Article 23(1) of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (272). Core questions about general-purpose AI’s labour
market impacts include which sectors will be most impacted by automation, how quickly
automation will be implemented in the economy, and whether general-purpose AI will increase or
decrease earnings inequality within and across countries.
The magnitude of general-purpose AI’s impact on labour markets will in large part depend on how
quickly its capabilities improve. Current general-purpose AI systems can already perform many
cognitive tasks, but often require human oversight and correction (see 1.2. Current capabilities). The
wide range of projections regarding the progress of future general-purpose AI (see 1.3. Capabilities
in coming years) highlights the uncertainty surrounding how soon these systems might reliably
perform complex tasks with minimal supervision. If general-purpose AI systems improve gradually
over multiple decades, their effects on wages are more likely to be incremental. Rapid
improvements in reliability and autonomy could cause more harmful disruption within a decade,
including sudden wage declines and involuntary job transitions (646). Slower progress would give
workers and policymakers more time to adapt and shape general-purpose AI's impact on the
labour market.
However, the pace of general-purpose AI adoption will also significantly affect how quickly labour
markets change, even in scenarios where capabilities improve substantially. If general-purpose AI
systems can boost productivity, there will be economic pressure to adopt them quickly, especially
if costs to use general-purpose AI continue to fall (see 1.3. Capabilities in coming years). However,
integrating general-purpose AI across the economy is likely to require complex system-wide
changes (656). Previous technological changes suggest that adopting and integrating new
automation technology can take decades (657), and cost barriers may slow adoption initially. For
example, one study estimates that only 23% of potentially automatable vision tasks would
currently be cost-effective for businesses to automate with computer vision technology (658).
Concerns about general-purpose AI’s reliability in high-stakes domains can also slow adoption
(659). Regulatory action or preferences for human-produced goods are other factors that could at
least initially dampen AI's labour market impacts, even if general-purpose AI capabilities quickly
surpass human capabilities on many tasks (660). The mix of adoption pressures and barriers
makes predicting the pace of labour market transformation particularly complex for policymakers.
However, early evidence suggests that, at least by some measures, general-purpose AI is being
adopted faster than the internet or personal computer (661). 
Risks
 2.3 Systemic risks
113
Productivity gains from general-purpose AI adoption are likely to lead to mixed effects on wages
across different sectors, increasing wages for some workers while decreasing wages for others. In
occupations where general-purpose AI complements human labour, it can increase wages through
three main mechanisms. Firstly, general-purpose AI tools can directly augment human productivity,
allowing workers to accomplish more in less time (113, 662). If demand for worker output rises as
workers become more productive, this added productivity could boost wages for workers using
general-purpose AI who now experience increased demand for their work. Second,
general-purpose AI can boost wages by driving economic growth and boosting demand for labour
in tasks that are not yet automated (663, 664). Third, general-purpose AI can lead to the creation
of entirely new tasks and occupations for workers to perform (641, 644, 664). However,
general-purpose AI may also exert downward pressure on wages for workers in certain
occupations. As general-purpose AI increases the supply of certain skills in the labour market, it
may reduce demand for humans with those same skills. Workers specialising in tasks that can be
automated by general-purpose AI may therefore face decreased wages or job loss (643). For
example, one study found that four months after ChatGPT was released, it had caused a 2% drop in
the number of writing jobs posted on an online labour market and a 5.2% drop in monthly earnings
for writers on the platform (645). The impact on wages in a given sector largely depends on how
much additional demand exists for that sector's services when costs fall due to general-purpose
AI-driven productivity gains. Furthermore, the share of any AI-driven profits that are captured by
workers will depend on factors such as the market structures and labour policies in affected
industries, which vary greatly across countries.
General-purpose AI will likely have the most significant near-term impact on jobs that consist
mainly of cognitive tasks. Several studies show that general-purpose AI capabilities overlap with
the capabilities needed to perform tasks in a wide range of jobs, with cognitive tasks most likely to
be impacted (637*, 640, 665, 666). Research has also found that general-purpose AI provides large
productivity gains for workers performing many kinds of cognitive tasks. This includes work in
occupations such as strategy consulting (667), legal work (668), professional writing (651),
computer programming (113), and others. For example, customer service agents received an
average productivity boost of 14% from using general-purpose AI (662). Additionally, software
developers were found to perform an illustrative coding task 55.8% faster when they had access to
a general-purpose AI programming assistant (114*). Sectors that rely heavily on cognitive tasks,
such as Information, Education, and the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services sector, are
also adopting AI at higher rates, suggesting that workers in these industries are poised to be most
impacted by general-purpose AI in the near-term (669).
AI agents have the potential to affect workers more significantly than general-purpose AI systems
that require significant human oversight. ‘AI agents’ are general-purpose AI systems that can
accomplish multi-step tasks in pursuit of a high-level goal with little or no human oversight. This
means that agents are able to chain together multiple complex tasks, potentially automating entire
workflows rather than just individual tasks (670). By removing the need for human involvement in
long sequences of work, AI agents could perform tasks and projects more cheaply than 
Risks
 2.3 Systemic risks
114
general-purpose AI systems that require more human oversight (671, 672). This is likely to
incentivise increased rates of adoption of agents for the purposes of automation in economically
competitive environments (671, 673). The resulting acceleration in automation could cause more
rapid disruption to skill demands and wages across multiple sectors (670), giving policymakers less
time to implement policy measures that strengthen worker resilience.
Involuntary job loss can cause long-lasting and severe harms for affected workers. Studies show
that displaced workers experience sharp drops in earnings and consumption immediately after
being displaced, with earnings deficits persisting for years afterward (674, 675). Estimates of wage
declines even after re-employment range from 5%–30% for as long as 20 years after displacement
(676, 677, 678, 679). Involuntary job loss can also significantly affect physical health, with evidence
suggesting that displacement increases mortality risk by 50–100% within the year after separation
and by 10–15% annually for the next 20 years (680). Studies also link job loss to higher rates of
depression (681), suicide (682), alcohol-related disease (682), and negative impacts on children’s
educational attainment (683). Given general-purpose AI's potential to cause job displacement,
these findings underscore the importance of policy measures to support affected workers.
Improved general-purpose AI capabilities will likely increase the risks that current systems present
to worker autonomy and workplace well-being. Today's narrow AI systems are already used to
assign tasks, monitor productivity, and evaluate worker performance in settings ranging from
warehouses to call centres (684). While these systems can increase productivity (685), studies
show that they often harm worker wellbeing through continuous monitoring and AI-driven workload
decisions (686). Many employers adopt these systems without sufficient testing or without fully
understanding their impacts on the workforce (687). This may be particularly concerning when AI
management systems influence critical decisions such as hiring and termination (687). It remains to
be seen whether general-purpose AI will enable more extensive algorithmic management than
narrow AI systems that are often used today. If general-purpose AI systems improve at integrating
and analysing diverse data streams, this would likely enable more granular monitoring and
decision-making across workplaces, potentially increasing both efficiency and risks to worker
autonomy.
General-purpose AI could increase income inequality within countries by providing greater
productivity boosts to high earners, but impacts are likely to vary across countries. Over the last
several decades automation of routine jobs increased wage inequality in the US context by
displacing middle-wage workers from jobs where they previously had a comparative advantage
(688, 689, 690). For example, one study estimates that 50–70% of the increase in US wage
inequality over the last four decades can be explained by relative wage declines of workers
specialised in routine tasks in industries that experienced high levels of automation (688).
General-purpose AI could compete with human workers in a similar fashion, potentially depressing
wages for some workers (691, 692) while being most likely to boost the productivity of those who
are already in relatively high-income occupations (see Figure 2.6) (637*). One simulation suggests
that AI could increase wage inequality between high- and low-income occupations by 10% within a

 2.3 Systemic risks
115
decade in advanced economies (640). Across many types of cognitive tasks, however, there is
evidence that at the current level of model capabilities, those with less experience or more
elementary skill sets often get the largest productivity boosts from using general-purpose AI (114*,
651, 662, 667, 668). This suggests that within cognitive-task oriented occupations, lesser paid
workers could actually get a larger boost than high earners and wage inequality within those
occupations could shrink (693). How these countervailing effects will play out across the economy
is uncertain and is likely to vary across countries, sectors, and occupations.

Figure 2.6: Large Language Models (LLMs) have an unequal economic impact on different parts of the income
distribution. Exposure is highest for worker tasks at the upper end of annual wages, peaking at approximately
$90,000/year in the US, while low and middle incomes are significantly less exposed. In this figure, ‘exposure’ signifies the
potential for productivity gains from AI, which can manifest in worker augmentation and wage boosts or automation and
wage declines, depending on a variety of other factors. Source: Eloundou et al., 2024 (637*).

General-purpose AI-driven labour automation is likely to exacerbate inequality by reducing the
share of all income that goes to workers relative to capital owners. Globally, labour's share of
income has fallen by roughly six percentage points between 1980 and 2022 (694). Typically, 10% of
all earners receive the majority of capital income (695, 696). If AI automates a significant share of
labour, then these trends could intensify by both reducing work opportunities for wage earners and
by increasing the returns to capital ownership (697, 698). Additionally, evidence suggests that
general-purpose AI can aid the creation of large 'superstar' firms that capture a large share of
economic profits, which would further increase capital-labour inequality (699).

General-purpose AI technology is likely to exacerbate global inequality if primarily adopted by
high-income countries (HICs). HICs have a higher share of the cognitive task-oriented jobs that are
most exposed to general-purpose AI impacts (640). These countries have stronger digital
infrastructure, skilled workforces, and more developed innovation ecosystems (700) (see 2.3.2.
Global AI R&D divide). This positions them to capture general-purpose AI productivity gains more
rapidly than emerging markets and developing economies. This would contribute to divergent
income growth trajectories and a widening gap between HICs and low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs) (701). If the most advanced, labour-automating AI is used by companies in HICs,
this could also attract additional capital investment to those countries, and further drive an
economic divergence between high- and low-income regions (702). Additionally, as firms in
advanced economies adopt general-purpose AI, they may find it more cost-effective to automate
production domestically rather than offshore work, eroding a traditional development pathway for
developing economies that export labour-intensive services (703). One study suggests this
dynamic may be most likely to play out in countries with a large share of the workforce in
outsourced IT services such as customer service, copywriting, and digital gig-economy jobs (704).
However, the precise impact on labour markets in developing economies remains unclear. On the
one hand, they could face a double challenge of losing existing jobs to automation while finding it
harder to attract new investment, as labour cost advantages become less relevant. On the other
hand, if general-purpose AI is widely adopted in developing economies, it could provide
productivity boosts for some skilled workers (662, 705, 706), potentially creating opportunities for
these workers to compete for remote work opportunities with higher-paid counterparts in HICs.
Since the publication of the Interim Report, new evidence suggests that rates of
general-purpose AI adoption by individuals may be faster than previous technologies such as
the internet or personal computers, though the pace of adoption by businesses varies widely
by sector (see Figure 2.7) (661). For example, a recent survey in the US found that more than
24% of workers use generative AI at least once a week, and one in nine use it daily at work
(661). Business adoption rates vary significantly across sectors (707). For example, in the US,
approximately 18.1% of businesses in the Information sector report using AI (broadly defined),
while only 1.4% in Construction and Agriculture do (669). For firms who report using AI, 27%
report replacing worker tasks, while only 5% report employment changes due to AI, more than
half of which are employment increases rather than decreases (708). Current evidence on
general-purpose AI adoption rates is limited by limited international data collection,
particularly outside of the US, though one survey of over 15,000 workers across 16 countries
found that 55% of respondents use generative AI at least once a week in their work (709).
Across the globe, a large gender gap exists in both adoption and potential labour market
impacts from general-purpose AI. For example, a recent meta-analysis of ten studies from
various countries suggests that women are 24.6% less likely to use generative AI than men
(710).

Figure 2.7: So far, generative AI appears to have been adopted at a faster pace than PCs or the internet in the US. Faster
adoption compared with PCs is driven by much greater use outside of work, probably due to differences in portability

Additionally, since the publication of the Interim Report, new evidence has shown that
general-purpose AI can deliver meaningful productivity gains in real-world work settings and
is poised to drive gains in science and R&D. New evidence demonstrates productivity impacts
across several real-world work environments, and finds that these impacts vary by
occupation, by business, and are mediated by the rate of adoption and usage within a firm
(711*). Recent research also found that each 10x increase in compute used to train a model
allowed workers to complete certain translation tasks 12.3% faster with improved quality when
they used the model as an assistant (706). The extent to which this relationship applies to
other work tasks remains unclear, however. Furthermore, the impact of productivity gains
from general-purpose AI on worker skill development versus skill decline is an emerging
research topic. One recent study found that while using ChatGPT can enhance some worker
capabilities, skills and knowledge are mostly not retained once access is removed (712*).
Finally, in one recent study focused on the US labour market, technology and R&D-focused
jobs were found to have the highest proportion of their job tasks exposed to potential
productivity gains from general-purpose AI (637*). This provides some suggestive evidence
that recently observed large productivity impacts of narrow AI systems on scientific
discovery (713) could potentially be accentuated by general-purpose AI across a broader
range of R&D tasks. This is notable, since increasing the productivity of R&D can significantly
boost technological progress and economic growth (714).

The main evidence gaps around labour market risks include uncertain long-term employment
impacts, limited international data on adoption, and untested policy responses.
Comprehensive studies on general-purpose AI's long-term effects on employment and wages
across different sectors are notably absent. There is limited understanding of adoption
patterns outside the US, making it difficult to anticipate international impacts. Data on new job
creation from general-purpose AI adoption is insufficient to guide worker retraining
programmes. Most crucially for policymakers, there is little evidence about which
interventions effectively protect workers during technological transitions. For example, while
retraining is often suggested as a response to changing skill demands, there is limited
evidence of its effectiveness (715), particularly given how quickly general-purpose AI might
alter required workplace skills. These gaps exist partly because general-purpose AI is still
nascent, making long-term impacts hard to measure, and partly because it is challenging to
isolate general-purpose AI's effects from other economic factors. The rapid pace of
general-purpose AI development also means that evidence about the effectiveness of policy
responses to previous technological change may not translate to this context.
For policymakers working on labour market risks from general-purpose AI, key challenges
include balancing AI innovation with worker protection, creating policy that can quickly adapt
to evolving impacts, and ensuring economic benefits are shared both within and across
countries. A central challenge is balancing innovation (which could boost productivity and
growth) against protecting workers from wage declines and the harms associated with
involuntary job loss (654). Policies must be adaptable given the speed of general-purpose AI
development and the uncertainty about future impacts (716). However, policymakers face the
challenge of setting flexible policy while still providing enough regulatory certainty to facilitate
business investment and worker training decisions. Closely monitoring key trends can help
policymakers increase their foresight into general-purpose AI’s labour market impacts. These
include sector-specific AI adoption rates, changes in wage distributions across industries,
emergence of new job categories, and shifts in skill demands from employers as
general-purpose AI systems progress and are more widely adopted. Finally, as the labour
market impacts of AI are expected to vary significantly between countries, policymakers face
challenges in coordinating international responses to prevent a widening global economic
divide and ensure that AI can accelerate inclusive economic growth.

2.3.2. Global AI R&D divide
KEY INFORMATION

● Large companies in countries with strong digital infrastructure lead in general-purpose AI
R&D, which could lead to an increase in global inequality and dependencies. For example,
in 2023, the majority of notable general-purpose AI models (56%) were developed in the
US. This disparity exposes many LMICs to risks of dependency and could exacerbate
existing inequalities.
● The rising cost for developing general-purpose AI is the main reason for this ‘AI R&D
divide’. Access to large and expensive quantities of computing power has become a
prerequisite for developing advanced general-purpose AI. Academic institutions and most
companies, especially those in LMICs, do not have the means to compete with large tech
companies.
● Attempts at closing the AI R&D divide have not been successful. An increasing number of
efforts have been focused on democratising access to compute, investing in AI skills
training in LMICs, and open sourcing prominent AI models. But these efforts will require
considerable financial investment and significant time to implement.
● Recent work suggests the AI R&D divide might widen further due to a trend of increasing
R&D costs at the frontier. Since the publication of the Interim Report (May 2024),
researchers have published new evidence on the rising costs of developing
state-of-the-art AI, growing disparities in the concentration of AI talent, and increasing
centralisation of computing resources needed to train large general-purpose AI models.
● There is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of potential ways to address the AI R&D
divide. For example, the impact of AI training programmes or infrastructure investments in
LMICs remains unclear.
Key Definitions

● Digital divide: The disparity in access to information and communication technology (ICT),
particularly the internet, between different geographic regions or groups of people.
● AI R&D divide: The disparity in AI research and development across different geographic
regions, caused by various factors including an unequal distribution of computing power,
talent, financial resources, and infrastructure.
● Digital infrastructure: The foundational services and facilities necessary for digital
technologies to function, including hardware, software, networks, data centres, and
communication systems.
● Ghost work: The hidden labour performed by workers to support the development and
deployment of AI models or systems (for example through data labelling).
Risks
 2.3 Systemic risks
120
The uneven global distribution of compute, talent, financial resources, and digital infrastructure
contributes to an AI R&D divide that could expose many LMICs to dependency risks and hinder
their advancement in general-purpose AI R&D. The steep financial costs of developing and running
general-purpose AI systems (27) may limit general-purpose AI R&D output from LMICs, potentially
exacerbating existing inequalities. Researchers in LMICs, who are often unable to train LLMs due to
high costs, will tend to rely upon existing open-weight models, which are primarily developed in
countries with strong digital infrastructure (717). These models are likely to not fully capture
nuances (grammatical structure, non-Latin scripts, tonal differences, etc.) of non-Western
languages, which are underrepresented in the training data, leading to lower accuracy (718).
Additionally, reliance on North American and Chinese companies for access to compute and
open-weight models typically comes with copyright and privacy restrictions that limit the ability of
researchers and developers within many LMICs to create state-of-the-art models (719). Thus,
these researchers often depend on collaborations with stakeholders in countries with stronger
digital infrastructure to access compute and publish in top-tier venues. Finally, as countries like the
US and China continue to lead in skilled AI talent production, researchers and students in other
countries are often reliant on institutions in those leading countries for academic and career
advancement in AI. This may exacerbate disparities in AI R&D, as talent moves from other countries
to countries where an AI industry is already concentrated (720).
A main driver of the AI R&D divide is the difference in access to compute between different actors.
This includes the unequal access to powerful computing resources (graphics processing units
(GPUs), data centres, cloud services, etc.) that are necessary to train and deploy large and complex
AI models. In recent years, this divide has widened (721, 722). This unequal access is most apparent
in the different extent to which large AI companies and academic AI labs have access to computing
resources. Estimates show that US technology companies are the major buyers of NVIDIA H100
GPUs, one of the most powerful GPU chip types on the market explicitly designed for AI (723).
However, several major technology companies have all recently announced that they are
developing custom AI chips to reduce their dependence on the AI chip supply chain, potentially
paving the way for more widespread access to GPUs. But the exceptionally high cost of GPUs
(typically $20,000-$30,000 for top-tier GPUs such as the H100 as of November 2024), thousands
or tens of thousands of which are typically used to train a leading general-purpose AI model, could
still hinder most LMICs from affording this level of AI infrastructure. The rising cost of establishing
and maintaining data centres also contributes to unequal access to compute. Over the past
decade, large tech companies have increased their investments in data centres, with Google
unveiling a $600 million data centre in Nebraska in 2022 (724*) and recently announcing a plan to
build a $1 billion data centre in Missouri (725). Meta has invested over $2 billion in a data centre in
Oregon (726*), and Microsoft has announced a $1 billion initiative to build a data centre campus,
along with other AI development efforts, in Kenya (727*). While such efforts will aid significantly in
increasing access to compute in general, they are unlikely to meaningfully mitigate the AI R&D
divide. 
Risks
 2.3 Systemic risks
121
Disparities in the concentration of skilled talent also contribute to the global AI R&D divide. AI R&D
is primarily concentrated in two countries – the US and China – which have made significant
investments toward recruiting and retaining AI talent. The US has the largest percentage of elite AI
researchers, contains a majority of the institutions that conduct top-tier research, and is the top
destination for AI talent globally (728). Additionally, there exist disparities in where students can
access AI-related degree programmes, as many of the top universities for AI are based in the US or
the UK (729), and the vast majority of English university courses on AI are offered in the UK, US, and
Canada (730). While some LMICs, such as India and Malaysia, are increasing their respective AI
course offerings (731), there is much more work needed to understand this disparity, as there is
limited data on formal university programmes in AI throughout LMICs, particularly those offered in
non-English languages.
The delegation of lower-level AI work to workers in LMICs has led to a 'ghost work' industry. The
increasing demand for data to train general-purpose AI systems, including human feedback to aid
in training, has further increased the reliance on ‘ghost work’ (732). ‘Ghost work’ is mostly hidden
labour performed by workers – often in precarious conditions – to support the development of AI
models. Firms have sprung up that help big technology companies to outsource various aspects of
data production, including data collection, cleaning, and annotation. This work can provide people in
LMICs with opportunities. On the other hand, the contract-style nature of this work often provides
few benefits and worker protections and less job stability, as platforms rotate markets to find
cheaper labour. Research has shown that these workers face exposure to graphic content, erratic
schedules, heavy workloads, and limited social and economic mobility (733, 734, 735, 736).
Exposure to such graphic content can lead to PTSD and other mental trauma (737, 738).

Since the publication of the Interim Report, more evidence of the increased costs associated
with general-purpose AI development has emerged, making a further widening of the AI R&D
divide appear likely. The development of notable general-purpose AI models is still led by
companies in countries with strong digital infrastructure and access to compute, and the
abilities of these models are increasing. Researchers have provided strong evidence that the
usage of resources like electricity in AI development is increasing (739). The cost of training
state-of-the-art AI models has grown 2–3x per year over the past eight years and could
reach a cost of over USD $1 billion by 2027 (27). However, there is some evidence of
improvement in talent concentration and state-of-the-art model development from LMICs.
For example, India has been particularly successful at increasing its concentration of skilled AI
talent, which has increased by 263% since 2016 (740). Research indicates that the
development of general-purpose AI may significantly impact IT services outsourced to LMICs,
such as customer service, copywriting, and gig work (704).
A key evidence gap around the AI R&D divide is the lack of evidence on feasible solutions.
Large technology companies have increasingly invested in AI and digital skills training efforts
across Africa, Latin America, and Asia, and these programmes are likely to increase as these
regions expand the capabilities of state-of-the-art models for local consumers. 
Risks
 2.3 Systemic risks
122
However, there is no evidence that such training improves the production of significant AI
models, particularly from LMICs. There is also only limited evidence on the benefits of
investments in AI-specific infrastructure, given the large disparities in AI talent between many
LMICs and countries like the United States and China. At the moment, it is unclear whether
access to infrastructure would increase talent, or whether this infrastructure would go unused
due to a lack of skilled experts. There is also limited data on the full scope of the AI R&D
divide, since metrics often measure research output in top-tier journals and conferences,
which are all published in English. Structural barriers, such as visa restrictions and financial
burdens, often prevent qualified international researchers, particularly from LMICs, from
attending major conferences or publishing in costly journals. The effects of the AI R&D divide
are also spillover impacts from the existing digital divide (741), making it hard to disentangle
the specific impacts of general-purpose AI on the global AI R&D divide.
Reducing the AI R&D divide is a hard problem for policymakers to tackle. General-purpose AI
development costs are inaccessible for the majority of LMICs, and investments in basic
infrastructure such as electricity grids and internet networks are estimated to cost billions (USD)
for countries like Nigeria (742). Additionally, none of these countries have companies that could
handle the expenses of developing general-purpose AI systems individually. There is limited
evidence on outcomes of digital skills training, which may impede further efforts to develop
targeted skills training programmes that might have a significant impact on LMIC contributions to
general-purpose AI models. There are also projections that disparities in AI talent concentration
might widen. Countries such as the US, UK, China, and countries across Europe are rapidly
increasing recruitment of AI talent, with some offering immigration pathways for skilled talent to
contribute to AI R&D within their respective countries (743, 744, 745). Policymakers, particularly in
many LMICs, will have to analyse the implications of this for their regional autonomy and their
efforts to lessen the AI R&D divide.

2.3.3. Market concentration and single points of failure
KEY INFORMATION

● Market shares for general-purpose AI tend to be highly concentrated among a few players,
which can create vulnerability to systemic failures. The high degree of market concentration
can invest a small number of large technology companies with a lot of power over the
development and deployment of AI, raising questions about their governance. The
widespread use of a few general-purpose AI models can also make the financial, healthcare,
and other critical sectors vulnerable to systemic failures if there are issues with one such
model.
● The market is so concentrated because of high barriers to entry. Developing
state-of-the-art, general-purpose AI models requires substantial up-front investment. For
example, the overall costs for developing a state-of-the-art model can currently reach
hundreds of millions of US dollars. Key cost factors are computing power, highly skilled
labour and vast datasets.
● In addition, market leaders benefit from self-reinforcing dynamics that reward winners.
Economies of scale allow bigger AI companies to spread one-off development costs over an
ever-larger customer base, creating a cost advantage over smaller companies. Network
effects further allow larger companies to train future models with user data generated
through older models.
● Market concentration has continued to persist in 2024. Since the publication of the Interim
Report (May 2024), the previous consensus that market concentration in the
general-purpose AI market is high has continued to hold.
● There is little research on predicting or mitigating single points of failure in AI. This creates
challenges for policymakers. The absence of reliable prediction methods on how failures
may propagate through interconnected systems makes these risks hard to assess.

Key Definitions

● Market concentration: The degree to which a small number of companies control an
industry, leading to reduced competition and increased control over pricing and innovation.
● Single point of failure: A part in a larger system whose failure disrupts the entire system. For
example, if a single AI system plays a central role in the economy or critical infrastructure, its
malfunctioning could cause widespread disruptions across society.
The development of state-of-the-art general-purpose AI requires enormous financial investment,
often reaching hundreds of millions of US dollars (see Figure 2.8). These costs arise primarily from
three key areas: specialised computational resources, highly skilled AI expertise, and access to vast
datasets, which are frequently proprietary and expensive. Computational resources include
advanced hardware such as GPUs (graphics processing units) and TPUs (tensor processing units), 
Risks
 2.3 Systemic risks
124
cloud infrastructure, and the energy required for training large-scale AI models (739). Developing
high-quality datasets also involves significant costs due to processes such as collection,
annotation, and cleaning (746, 747). Furthermore, the recruitment and retention of top-tier AI
researchers, engineers, and data scientists is highly competitive and costly, as their expertise is
essential for developing cutting-edge algorithms and architectures.
Figure 2.8: Estimated training costs of AI models have sharply increased over the past few years. Only a few companies
can afford to train models at such high cost, further increasing market concentration. Source: Maslej et al., 2024a (730).
Access to massive datasets is crucial for training high-performance AI models. These datasets are
often proprietary, giving established firms a competitive edge (see 1.3. Capabilities in coming years).
Large technology companies are uniquely positioned to overcome these barriers due to their
existing financial resources, infrastructure, and ownership or control over vast amounts of data
through their existing platforms and services. In contrast, new firms face significant obstacles in
acquiring the necessary datasets and computing power, leading to a high barrier to entry (74, 748,
749, 750). As a result, smaller companies are often unable to compete, reinforcing the
concentration of market power among a few dominant players in the AI sector.
General-purpose AI systems benefit significantly from economies of scale, since larger, more
compute-intensive models tend to outperform their smaller counterparts on many metrics.
Large-scale models, such as those used for natural language processing, image recognition, and
decision-making, are capable of handling a broader range of tasks due to their increased capacity
to process and analyse vast amounts of data. As these models grow in size, this may also result in Training cost (USD)

better generalisation and accuracy (751), reinforcing the demand for high-performance,
general-purpose AI systems across industries. This creates a feedback loop where large-scale
models, which require substantial computational resources to develop, become more valuable and
sought after due to their performance and versatility. Since AI systems require significant upfront
investments in infrastructure and development (27), but only small costs per query, the average
cost per user decreases as the AI system is provided to more users, reflecting economies of scale.
This gives larger firms a competitive advantage, as they can spread the costs of development over
a larger customer base, making it difficult for smaller firms to compete. Additionally, these systems
benefit from network effects: as more users interact with them, they generate vast amounts of new
data that can be used to retrain and fine-tune the models (752, 753). This constant influx of
user-generated data improves the performance of the models, making them even more valuable
and effective over time.
These tendencies towards market concentration mean that a few companies will likely dominate
decision-making about the development and deployment of general-purpose AI. Since society at
large could benefit as well as suffer from these companies’ decisions, this raises questions about
the appropriate governance of these few large-scale systems. A single general-purpose AI model
could potentially influence decision-making across many organisations and sectors (748) in ways
that might be benign, subtle, inadvertent, or deliberately exploited. There is the potential for the
malicious use of general-purpose AI as a powerful tool for manipulation, persuasion, censorship and
control by a few companies or governments.

Since the publication of the Interim Report, the previous consensus that market concentration
in the general-purpose AI market is high has continued to hold, and some new research has
suggested a rising dependency on large AI companies. Increasing dependency on prominent
tech companies for access to essential hardware (GPUs), AI model interfaces (APIs), and cloud
storage services has significant implications for the AI ecosystem (754). Just three companies
control 67% of cloud computing services (see Figure 2.9). This reliance consolidates power
within a few major players, limiting competition and innovation among smaller firms that lack
the resources to invest in their own infrastructure. The market capitalisation of large tech
companies has increased since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, influencing their
accumulation and concentration of computing infrastructure, data, and human resources
needed to train advanced AI systems (755). Such accumulation of resources is driven by
companies’ reassessment of expected returns from investments into AI.
A single AI system can be adopted across critical sectors such as finance, healthcare, and
cybersecurity, making the systemic risks associated with market concentration particularly
pronounced. These sectors, which are interdependent and integral to national security and
economic stability, increasingly rely on AI for decision-making, threat detection, automation, and
resource optimisation. The dominant general-purpose AI models supplied by a few large companies
are used as the backbone for many of these applications, creating the potential for significant
vulnerabilities (757). A key concern is that flaws, vulnerabilities, bugs, or inherent biases in these
widely adopted AI systems could lead to simultaneous failures across multiple industries (758).
Different scenarios have been proposed that illustrate potential disruptions. For example, a
cybersecurity flaw in a dominant AI model could expose multiple financial institutions, government
agencies, and other critical systems to coordinated cyberattacks or system failures (759, 760).
Increasing the development of technical standards to identify and mitigate single points of failure
in AI could reduce risks. One way to mitigate risks from single points of failure is to make it less
likely that individual models fail or are unsafe in some way. Some examples of potential mitigations
that researchers have explored are the development of technical standards (761), along with
auditing and reporting requirements (762). However, these mitigations involve significant costs and
complexity (763). For a more detailed discussion of various such techniques, see 3. Technical
approaches to risk management.
A key evidence gap around market concentration risks is the absence of established methods
to model impacts from single points of failure in AI, which makes developing reliable
mitigation methods hard. It is difficult to predict how failures propagate across complex
societal systems. This makes it challenging to reliably predict potential disruptions or
understand their full scope. This uncertainty hampers efforts to design targeted safeguards,
as comprehensive data for policymakers and developers on where vulnerabilities lie and how
they manifest is still emerging (764). As a result, there is a risk of incomplete or ineffective
mitigation strategies, leaving critical sectors at continued risk of cascading failures from AI

system flaws. While researchers have begun developing methods to measure the reliability of
AI systems (765), they are few and limited in adoption.

A key challenge for policymakers seeking to reduce risks from market concentration in
general-purpose AI is that developing this technology is so capital-intensive, favouring
dominance of a few very large players. Common dynamics following attempts to reduce
market concentration illustrate this, as smaller firms quickly become acquisition targets for
larger competitors. For example, funding and resources may help smaller firms grow, but that
in turn tends to make them attractive acquisition opportunities for dominant tech companies
seeking to eliminate competition or expand their AI capabilities (766, 767).

2.3.4. Risks to the environment
KEY INFORMATION

● General-purpose AI is a moderate but rapidly growing contributor to global environmental
impacts through energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Current estimates
indicate that data centres and data transmission account for an estimated 1% of global
energy-related GHG emissions, with AI consuming 10–28% of data centre energy capacity.
AI energy demand is expected to grow substantially by 2026, with some estimates
projecting a doubling or more, driven primarily by general-purpose AI systems such as
language models.
● Recent advances in general-purpose AI capabilities have been largely driven by a marked
increase in the amount of computation that goes into developing and using AI models,
which uses more energy. While AI firms are increasingly powering their data centre
operations with renewable energy, a significant portion of AI training globally still relies on
high-carbon energy sources such as coal or natural gas, leading to the aforementioned
emissions and contributing to climate change.
● AI development and deployment also has significant environmental impacts through water
and resource consumption, and through AI applications that can either harm or benefit
sustainability efforts. AI consumes large amounts of water for energy production,
hardware manufacturing, and data centre cooling. All of these demands increase
proportionally to AI development, use, and capability. AI can also be used to facilitate
environmentally detrimental activities such as oil exploration, as well as in environmentally
friendly applications with the potential to mitigate or help society adapt to climate
change, such as optimising systems for energy production and transmission.
● Current mitigations include improving hardware, software, and algorithmic energy
efficiency and shifting to carbon-free energy sources, but so far these strategies have
been insufficient to curb GHG emissions. Increases in technology efficiency and uptake of
renewable energy have not kept pace with increases in demand for energy: technology
firms’ GHG emissions are often growing despite substantial efforts to meet net-zero
carbon goals. Significant technological advances in general-purpose AI hardware or
algorithms, or substantial shifts in electricity generation, storage and transmission, will be
necessary to meet future demand without environmental impacts increasing at the same
pace.
● Since the publication of the Interim Report (May 2024), there is additional evidence that
the demand for energy to power AI workloads is significantly increasing. General-purpose
AI developers reported new challenges in meeting their net-zero carbon pledges due to
increased energy use stemming from developing and providing general-purpose AI
models, with some reporting increased GHG emissions in 2023 compared to 2022. In
response, some firms are turning to virtually carbon-free nuclear energy to power AI data
centres.
Risks
 2.3 Systemic risks
129
● The main evidence gaps around general-purpose AI energy use and GHG emissions are
the lack of precise estimates of the total energy use or emissions due to general-purpose
AI, and the difficulty of anticipating corresponding future trends. There is insufficient
public information regarding current patterns in AI energy use, such as how much data
centre capacity can be attributed to general-purpose AI compared to other workloads,
and how much energy or other environmental impacts can be attributed to different AI
use cases or capabilities. Current figures largely rely on estimates, which become even
more variable and unreliable when extrapolated into the future due to the rapid pace of
development in the field.

Key Definitions

● GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions: Release of gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane,
nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons which create a barrier trapping heat in the
atmosphere. A key indicator of climate change.
● Carbon intensity: The amount of GHG emissions produced per unit of energy. Used to
quantify the relative emissions of different energy sources.
● Compute: Shorthand for ‘computational resources’, which refers to the hardware (e.g. GPUs),
software (e.g. data management software) and infrastructure (e.g. data centres) required to
train and run AI systems.
● Data centre: A large collection of networked, high-power computer servers used for remote
computation. Hyperscale data centres typically contain more than 5000 servers.
● Rebound effect: In economics, the reduction in expected improvements due to increases in
efficiency, resulting from correlated changes in behaviour, use patterns, or other systemic
changes. For example, improving automotive combustion engine efficiency (km/litre) by 25%
will lead to less than a 25% reduction in emissions, because the corresponding reduction in
the cost of gas per kilometre driven will make it cheaper to drive more, limiting
improvements.
● Carbon offsetting: Compensating for GHG emissions from one source by investing in other
activities that prevent comparable amounts of emissions or remove carbon from the
atmosphere, such as expanding forests.
● Institutional Transparency: The degree to which AI companies disclose technical or
organisational information to public or governmental scrutiny, including training data, model
architectures, emissions data, safety and security measures, or decision-making processes.
Recent advances in general-purpose AI capabilities have largely been powered by a rapid increase
in the amount of computation that goes into developing and using AI models. The most
straightforward methodology for improving general-purpose AI performance on end-tasks is to
allow the model to learn from as many data examples as possible. This is achieved by increasing the
size of the model, measured as the number of parameters, roughly in proportion with the amount of
available data (156*, 157*). In order for a bigger model to learn its parameters from the data (in
training and development) and use those parameters to produce outputs on new data 
Risks
 2.3 Systemic risks
130
(in deployment or use), it needs to perform more calculations, which requires more computational
power (see 1.3. Capabilities in coming years for further discussion).
General-purpose AI requires significant energy to develop and use, with corresponding GHG
emissions and impacts to the energy grid. For example, Meta estimates that the energy required to
train their recent (July, 2024) Llama 3 family of LLMs resulted in 11,380 tonnes of CO2 equivalent
(tCO2e) emissions across the four released models (11*). The total emissions equate to the energy
consumed by 1,484 average US homes for one year, or 2,708 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles
driven for one year (768). Google reports that training their open source Gemma 2 family of LLMs
emitted 1247.61 tCO2e (769*), but like most developers of general-purpose AI, they do not disclose
the amount of energy or emissions required to power production models. Additional energy is
required to power the data centres within which most general-purpose AI computation is
performed, most notably for cooling. This additional energy overhead is typically quantified as
power usage effectiveness (PUE), which is a ratio between the amount of energy used for
computation and for other uses within a data centre; the optimal theoretical PUE, indicating zero
energy overhead, is 1.0. The most efficient hyperscale data centres, including many of the data
centres powering general-purpose AI, currently report a PUE of around 1.1, with the industry average
hovering around 1.6 (770). Energy use also arises from data transmission across computer networks,
which is required to communicate the inputs to and outputs of AI models between users’ devices,
such as laptops and mobile phones, and the data centres where AI models are run. Approximately
260–360 TWh energy was required to support global data transmission networks in 2022, a similar
amount as was used to power data centres (240–340 TWh, excluding cryptocurrency mining which
amounted to an additional 100–150 TWh) in that same year (771). Google, Meta, Amazon, and
Microsoft alone, leaders in providing general-purpose AI and other cloud compute services, were
collectively responsible for 69% of global data transmission traffic, representing a shift from
previous years when the majority of data transmissions were attributed to public internet service
providers (772).
Although reporting often focuses on the energy cost of model training, there is strong evidence
that a higher energy demand arises from their everyday use. Training and development
corresponds to a lower number of high energy use activities, whereas deployment corresponds to a
very high number of lower-energy uses (since each user query represents an energy cost) (739,
773, 774). While the most reliable estimates of energy use and GHG emissions due to
general-purpose AI typically measure their training costs, such as those cited above, available
reports suggest a greater overall proportion of energy expenditure due to use. In 2022, Google and
Meta reported that the use of AI systems accounted for 60–70% of the energy associated with
their AI workloads, compared to 0–40% for training and 10% for development (i.e. research and
experimentation) (199, 206).
Pre-processing and generating data for general-purpose AI also has significant energy costs. Meta
further reported that data processing, i.e. filtering and converting data to the appropriate formats
for training AI models, accounted for 30% of the energy footprint for a production model developed

in 2021 for personalised recommendation and ranking, and the overall computation devoted to data
pre-processing increased by 3.2x from 2019–2021 (199). Large general-purpose AI models give rise
to more computation for data processing than narrow AI models. Not only do general-purpose AI
models consume substantially more data than narrow models, but the models themselves are
increasingly used to generate additional synthetic data during the training process and to pick the
best synthetic data to train on (37*, 775, 776*). They are also used to generate data for training
narrow AI models (777). However, recent figures providing similarly detailed attribution of
general-purpose AI energy use are not available. The limited availability of broader data quantifying
AI energy use has resulted in recent mandates, such as in the EU AI Act, focusing on model training
despite the need for increased reporting and characterisation of the demands due to data
processing and model use (778).
Currently, the GHG emissions of general-purpose AI primarily arise from the carbon intensity of
energy sources used to power the data centres and data transmission networks supporting their
training and use. For example, renewable sources such as solar power emit far less GHG compared
to fossil fuels (779*). While AI firms are increasingly powering their data centre operations with
renewable energy (199, 206, 780*, 781), a significant portion of AI compute globally still relies on
high-carbon sources such as coal or natural gas (779*). This results in significant GHG emissions.
There are varying estimates of the total energy use and GHG emissions related to data centres and
AI. According to estimates from the International Energy Agency (IEA), data centres and data
transmission make up 1% of global GHG emissions related to energy use, and 0.6% of all GHG
emissions (which also includes other GHG sources such as agriculture and industrial processes)
(770, 771, 782). Between 10% to 28% of energy use in data centres stems from the use of AI in
recent estimates, mostly due to generative AI (LLMs and image generation models) which makes up
most of the energy use due to general-purpose AI (770, 771, 782). Combining these estimates would
suggest that the use of AI is responsible for 0.1–0.28% of global GHG emissions attributed to
energy use and 0.06–0.17% of all GHG emissions, but the exact percentages depend on how much
of the energy used comes from carbon-intensive energy sources. The average carbon intensity of
electricity powering data centres in the US is 548 grams CO2 per kWh, which is almost 50% higher
than the US national average (783). Factors affecting GHG emissions include the location of data
centres and time of day of energy use, data centre efficiency, and the efficiency of the hardware
used. As a result, the actual GHG emissions for a given amount of energy consumed by AI can vary
considerably.
Since the publication of the Interim Report, there is additional evidence of increased energy
demand to power data centres running AI workloads. As of October 2024, the IEA predicts
that data centres will account for less than 10% of global electricity demand growth between
2023 and 2030 (784). Most of the overall growth in demand is predicted to arise from other
growing sources of electricity demand, such as uptake of electric vehicles and increased
needs for cooling buildings. However, data centre impacts are highly localised compared to
other industries, leading to uneven distribution of the increased demand and 
Risks

disproportionately high impacts in certain areas (784). For example, data centres consumed
over 20% of all electricity in Ireland in 2023 (785), and electricity use is growing in the US,
home to more than half of global data centre capacity (786), for the first time in over a
decade, driven in part by increased development and use of AI (787). Technology firms are
turning to nuclear power (which has its own complex benefits and risks) as a carbon-neutral
energy source to power data centres, with multiple large tech firms signing deals with power
providers to secure nuclear energy. In September 2024, Microsoft signed a deal that will
re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, agreeing to purchase all of
the plant’s generation capacity for the next 20 years, enough to power approximately
800,000 homes (788*). Amazon signed a similar deal in March to purchase up to 960
MW/year of nuclear energy to power a data centre campus for their Amazon Web Services
(AWS) cloud platform (789), representing the first instance of data centre co-location with a
nuclear power plant. However, in November the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
rejected the transmission provider’s request to amend their interconnection service
agreement to increase transmission to the data centre (790), casting some doubts on
whether regulators will support such co-location moving forward. In October, Google
announced an agreement to purchase nuclear energy from small modular reactors (SMRs), the
world’s first corporate agreement of this kind, stating that they needed this new electricity
source to “support AI technologies” (791*).
There are several potential mitigations for the increasing energy use and GHG emissions of
general-purpose AI systems, such as shifting to carbon-free energy, purchasing carbon offsets,
and improving efficiency of AI systems and data centres, but no silver bullet. As in other sectors,
continuing to shift general-purpose AI data centre energy to renewable energy sources such as
wind, hydroelectric and solar is a promising path forward, but currently limited by battery storage
and transmission technology; renewable sources cannot currently provide energy to data centres
that need it without interruptions, across geographically-diverse regions. As mentioned in the
previous paragraph, AI firms are expressing increased interest in nuclear energy sources,
particularly cheaper, safer SMRs, to fill the gap in the short to medium term. While SMRs provide
uninterrupted carbon-free energy, a recent report highlights that SMRs (<300 MW) produce more
nuclear waste per unit of energy produced than large-scale (>1000 MW) reactors by a factor of
2–30x (792). Improving the energy efficiency of general-purpose AI systems, measured as energy
used to reach a given capability level, is another way to mitigate energy use (206, 773). Smarter
resource allocation and scheduling is also a promising direction for mitigating GHG emissions.
General-purpose AI workloads can be paused during peak energy use times in order to reduce GHG
emissions by nearly 30% for some regions and energy mixes (793), but not all general-purpose AI
workloads are compatible with this approach, particularly model inference, which typically requires
the workload to be run immediately in order to return a response to the user immediately (e.g. when
a general-purpose AI summary is included as part of a web search). Further mitigation strategies
include developing sustainability impact assessments for AI development and deployment;
resource restrictions or conditions for AI training; and tradable energy budgets for AI training and
inference (794). 
Risks
 2.3 Systemic risks
133
Carbon offsets are a popular method used by general-purpose AI developers to mitigate GHG
emissions, but they do not always result in actual emissions reductions. Energy consumers
commonly attempt to mitigate their GHG emissions by engaging in renewable power purchase
agreements (PPAs), renewable energy credits (RECs), coal transition mechanisms (CTMs), or carbon
offset certificates in order to offset their emissions by purchasing equivalent renewable energy, or
by investing in other carbon-reduction or green energy transition projects. Carbon offsets are the
primary mechanism currently employed by technology firms to achieve net-zero carbon emissions
pledges, alongside increasing procurement of renewable energy sources to power data centre
energy use directly (780*, 795*, 796*). For example, Meta reports that they mitigated the emissions
due to LLM training cited above by purchasing an equivalent amount of renewable energy (11*). This
strategy also has limitations, due to the difficulty of verifying the additionality of offset projects, i.e.
ensuring that the emissions reductions would not have occurred regardless of the offset
programme (797).
General-purpose AI energy efficiency is improving rapidly, but not enough to stop the ongoing
growth of emissions. Specialised AI hardware and other hardware efficiency improvements enhance
the performance-per-watt of machine learning workloads over time (206). Moreover, new machine
learning techniques and architectures can also help reduce energy consumption (206), as can
improvements in the supporting software frameworks and algorithms (798, 799). Energy used per
unit of computation has been reduced by an estimated 26% per year (144). However, current rates
of efficiency improvement are insufficient to counter growing demand. Demand for computing
power used for AI training, which has been increasing by a factor of approximately 4x each year, is
so far significantly outpacing energy efficiency improvements (26). This mismatch is reflected in
the fact that technology firms involved in the development and deployment of general-purpose AI
report challenges in meeting environmental sustainability goals. Baidu reports that increased
energy requirements due to the “rapid development of LLMs” are posing “severe challenges” to
their development of green data centres (781), and Google similarly reports a 17% increase in data
centre energy consumption in 2023 over 2022 and a 37% increase in GHG emissions due to energy
use “despite considerable efforts and progress on carbon-free energy”. They attribute these
increases to increased investment in AI (780*).
Efficiency improvements alone have not negated the overall growth in energy use of AI and
possibly further accelerate it because of ‘rebound effects’. Economists have found for previous
technologies that improvements in energy efficiency tend to increase, rather than decrease, overall
energy consumption by decreasing the cost per unit of work (800). Efficiency improvements may
lead to greater energy consumption by making technologies such as general-purpose AI cheaper
and more readily available, and increasing growth in the sector.

Figure 2.10: US data centre energy use is projected to grow rapidly, reaching between 270–930 TWh annually by 2030.
This wide range in projections (varying by over 600 TWh, equivalent to >10% of total US 2022 energy use) stems from
rapidly evolving technology and limited historical data, particularly for AI-specific usage. Source: Kamiya, G. & Coroamǎ,
V.C., 2024 (801).
The main evidence gaps around general-purpose AI energy use and emissions are the lack of
precise estimates of the total energy use, emissions or resource consumption due to
general-purpose AI, and the difficulty of anticipating corresponding future trends. Bottom-up
estimates of energy use and emissions, such as those described above, are much easier to
calculate than top-down estimates for the entire sector. Increased development and use of
general-purpose AI is widely believed to be driving increases in demand for data centre
compute capacity and corresponding energy use, and so overall trends in data centre energy
use are assumed to reflect the growth in general-purpose AI development and use. As of
2023, data centres (excluding cryptocurrency mining) accounted for between 1% and 1.5% of
global electricity demand (802); roughly 2% in the EU, 4% in the US, and close to 3% in China
(213, 803, 804). In 2020 data centres and data transmission networks emitted 330 million

tCO2e overall, making up just under 1% of all energy-related GHG emissions, and 0.6% of global
GHG emissions overall (771). While AI is currently estimated to make up 10–30% of data centre
workloads (770, 782), demand for AI development and use (general-purpose and otherwise) is
expected to continue to grow in coming years. Some sources estimate that growth will double
data centre electricity demand, from 460 TWh in 2022 to more than 1000 TWh in 2026 (208).
Google reports emitting 14.3 million tCO2e in 2023, a 13% increase over 2022 and 48% increase
since 2019, which they attribute to increases in data centre energy consumption related to
increased integration of AI into products (780*). However, projections vary widely and it is
fundamentally challenging to project future use and growth of AI due to the rapid and
unpredictable pace of development in the technology (805). Figure 2.10 depicts the wide
range of available estimates for future data centre energy use in the US, which vary widely, as
much as 10% of the total electricity use in the US in 2022. It is typical to estimate future
trends by simply extrapolating from current demand and growth rate of an indicator. However,
this methodology ignores critical variables that dictate actual growth, and has proven
insufficient for accurately estimating demand due to technological developments. For
example, while global internet traffic (an indicator for data centre electricity use) grew by
more than ten times between 2010 and 2020, data centre electricity use only increased by
6% over the same period due to improvements in hardware and data centre efficiency (806).
A technological breakthrough in today’s general-purpose AI algorithms could similarly reduce
energy requirements, and current estimates of growth in energy use must take into account
additional factors that curb growth, such as limitations to the AI hardware supply chain, and
electricity generation capacity (784). Further, AI (general-purpose and otherwise) can also
have indirect environmental impacts (positive or negative) arising from specific applications
(774). For example, AI might be applied to accelerate discovery in materials science of a new
battery chemistry allowing for wider adoption of renewable energy, or in identifying catalysts
enabling more efficient carbon capture or hydrogen fuel production (807). AI can also be
applied towards environmentally detrimental goals such as oil and gas exploration and
extraction, leading to increased GHG emissions (807). Quantifying indirect impacts is even
more challenging than characterising its direct impacts due to, e.g. energy use, and more work
is needed to develop robust frameworks for life cycle assessment of general-purpose AI
models (774). Better reporting and characterisation of past and current energy demands, and
the dominant AI use cases fuelling them, is needed in order to gauge risk and develop
mitigation strategies for increasing energy demand and emissions due to general-purpose AI
(778). In order to remain on track with the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario, for
example, emissions due to data centres and data transmission would need to halve by 2030
(771), but it is not well known what proportion of those emissions can be attributed to
general-purpose AI, which general-purpose AI development and use cases are contributing
the most to those emissions and which are mitigating or reducing emissions elsewhere, and
how those trends are developing over time.
 
Risks
 2.3 Systemic risks
136
In addition to GHG emissions due to energy use, general-purpose AI has other environmental
impacts due to the physical systems and structures required for its development and use, which
are even less well understood. The GHG emissions due to energy use discussed so far are typically
referred to as operational emissions, and they currently contribute the highest proportion of
emissions. The embodied carbon footprint of AI hardware, which includes emissions from
manufacturing, transportation, the physical building infrastructure, and disposal, also contributes
significant GHG emissions. Depending on the location and scenario, this can be up to 50% of a
model’s total emissions (199). As operational energy efficiency improves, the embodied carbon
footprint will become a larger proportion of the total carbon footprint (808). Intel reports that its
Ocotillo campus generated over 200,000 tCO2e in 2023 from direct emissions alone (not including
electricity) (809*), and is on track to generate over 300,000 tCO2e by the end of 2024, having
consumed over 1 billion kWh energy in the first quarter of 2024 (809*). Estimating the current
embodied carbon footprint of general-purpose AI poses a great challenge due to a lack of data
from hardware manufacturers. This arises due to a combination of incentives, including
manufacturers’ desire to protect intellectual property around proprietary manufacturing processes
and the consolidation of expertise in manufacturing specialised AI hardware to a very limited
number of firms, limiting knowledge access and transfer.
Water consumption is another emerging area of environmental risk from general-purpose AI.
General-purpose AI development and use withdraws fresh water from local water systems, a
portion of which is then consumed, primarily through evaporation. As with energy use,
general-purpose AI water use also increases as models grow larger. General-purpose AI has both
embodied and operational water requirements. Embodied water consumption comes from water
use in the hardware manufacturing process, and operational water use primarily arises from energy
production and from evaporative cooling systems in data centres. In energy production, water
evaporates when used for cooling in nuclear and fossil-fuel combustion power plants and in
hydroelectric dams. In data centres, computer hardware also produces significant waste energy in
the form of heat, and must be cooled in order to optimise computational efficiency and longevity.
The most effective and widespread methods for cooling hardware in data centres evaporate water.
As the computation used for training and deploying general-purpose AI models increases, cooling
demands increase, too, leading to higher water consumption. Water is also consumed during
hardware manufacturing processes. In 2023, Intel’s water-efficient Ocotillo chip manufacturing
plant in Arizona, which has earned the highest certification for water conservation from the Alliance
for Water Stewardship, withdrew 10,561 million litres of water (90% fresh water) of which 1896
million litres were consumed (809*). Assuming an average household water use of 144 litres per day
(810), this equates to over 200,000 households’ yearly water withdrawal. Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturer and the main
supplier of chips to AI hardware firms such as Nvidia, reports that as of 2023 their per-unit water
consumption had increased by 25.2% since 2010, despite their goal to decrease usage by 2.7% over
that period, and by 30% by 2030; this is despite increased water-saving measures resulting in
TSMC conserving 33% more water year-over-year in 2023 (811). Water consumption by current
models and the methodology to assess it are still subject to scientific debate, but some 
Risks
 2.3 Systemic risks
137
researchers predict that water consumption by AI could ramp up to trillions of litres by 2027 (199,
812). In the context of concerns around global freshwater scarcity, and without technological
advances enabling emissions-efficient alternatives, AI’s water footprint might be a substantial
threat to the environment and the human right to water (813). In response to congressional
mandates, the US Department of Energy is currently working to assess current and near-future
data centre energy and water consumption needs, with a report to be released by the end of 2024
(787). European data centre operators must report water consumption beginning in 2025 (814).
Potential mitigations for AI-related water consumption include reducing energy use and developing
and deploying low-water processes for cooling and manufacturing. The same algorithmic and
software improvements deployed to mitigate energy consumption will also lead to some reduced
water consumption, since a portion of water consumption is due to energy use. Other energy use
mitigations, such as hardware efficiency improvements or shifting to carbon-free energy sources,
will not necessarily lead to reduced water use, and could increase it; improving hardware efficiency
implies manufacturing new hardware to replace old hardware, and nuclear power generation
requires more water for cooling than natural gas generation (815). Newer technologies, such as dry
cooling, can be used to reduce water withdrawals required for cooling in power plants, but dry
cooling decreases the efficiency of energy production (816). In data centres and hardware
manufacturing, water can be harvested and recycled, but this also requires increased energy input
in order to filter water to high purity, for example through reverse osmosis (809*, 817). These
examples highlight a common trade-off between energy use and water use concerns that must be
considered when developing policies around AI environmental impacts. Data centres can be built in
cold climate geographic regions amenable to natural air cooling, but logistical challenges in terms of
energy and data transmission, construction, and extreme weather limit the cost efficacy of this
approach at scale. Trigeneration, wherein waste heat from energy production is used to provide
cooling, can minimise water and energy use in data centres (818). However, current trigeneration
systems are typically powered by fossil fuel combustion and further research is needed to develop
trigeneration systems powered by carbon-free and low-water energy sources. Hydrogen plasma
cooling could also improve data centre cooling efficiency, but significant efforts are still needed to
develop robust infrastructure for producing hydrogen that does not rely on fossil fuels (819). In
conjunction with efforts to optimise manufacturing processes, hardware manufacturing firms have
begun to report or pledge ‘net positive’ water use, through a combination of reducing their water
consumption and funding external water restoration projects equivalent in gallons to their
consumption, in a similar vein to net-zero carbon pledges that leverage RECs or carbon offsets
(809*, 811), with similar challenges.
Policymakers face three core challenges in addressing AI's impact on the environment: limited
institutional transparency around energy use and emissions data, unclear relationships
between computational costs and whether the resulting capabilities are applied for
environmental benefit or harm, and high uncertainty due to rapid development. Limited data
is available for quantifying energy and emissions associated with general-purpose AI, which
limits researchers’ ability to analyse and forecast use patterns, and corresponding policy

development. However, existing reporting requirements still provide insufficient information
regarding AI specifically; they do not require developers to break down impacts by model use
phases (training versus use) or use cases (general-purpose versus task-specific, or whether
AI is being applied to mitigate or accelerate negative environmental impacts, such as to aid in
oil and gas extraction) (778). Additionally, there is a lack of understanding in the research
community regarding the amount of computation required to achieve a desired level of
capability from a general-purpose AI model. This limits the extent to which energy use targets
can be set for specific models or use cases, such as the amount of energy or emissions
allotted to generate an image, since the upper and lower bounds on required energy are either
very wide, or highly case-specific. Close collaboration and effective communication is needed
between domain experts and policymakers to ensure that policy decisions are based on
accurate data, and that mechanisms are put in place to ensure that better data is available in
the future to support policy development and implementation.

2.3.5. Risks to privacy
KEY INFORMATION

● General-purpose AI systems can cause or contribute to violations of user privacy.
Violations can occur inadvertently during the training or usage of AI systems, for example
through unauthorised processing of personal data or leaking health records used in
training. But violations can also happen deliberately through the use of general-purpose AI
by malicious actors; for example, if they use AI to infer private facts or violate security.
● General-purpose AI sometimes leaks sensitive information acquired during training or
while interacting with users. Sensitive information that was in the training data can leak
unintentionally when a user interacts with the model. In addition, when users share
sensitive information with the model to achieve more personalised responses, this
information can also leak or be exposed to unauthorised third parties.
● Malicious actors can use general-purpose AI to aid in the violation of privacy. AI systems
can facilitate more efficient and effective searches for sensitive data and can infer and
extract information about specific individuals from large amounts of data. This is further
exacerbated by the cybersecurity risks created by general-purpose AI systems (see 2.1.3.
Cyber offence).
● Since the publication of the Interim Report (May 2024), people increasingly use
general-purpose AI in sensitive contexts such as healthcare or workplace monitoring. This
creates new privacy risks which so far, however, have not materialised at scale. In addition,
researchers are trying to remove sensitive information from training data and build secure
deployment tools.
● For policymakers, it remains hard to know the scale or scope of privacy violations.
Assessing the extent of privacy violations from general-purpose AI is extremely
challenging, as many harms occur unintentionally or without the knowledge of the affected
individuals. Even for documented leaks, it can be hard to identify their source, as data is
often handled across multiple devices or in different parts of the supply chain.

Key Definitions

● Privacy: A person's or group's right to control how others access or process their sensitive
information and activities.
● Personally identifiable information (PII): Any data that can directly or indirectly identify an
individual (for example, names or ID numbers). Includes information that can be used alone
or combined with other data to uniquely identify a person.
● Sensitive data: Information that, if disclosed or mishandled, could result in harm,
embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual or organisation.
● Data minimisation: The practice of collecting and retaining only the data that is directly
necessary for a specific purpose, and deleting it once that purpose is fulfilled.
Risks
 2.3 Systemic risks
140
● Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): A technique that allows LLMs to draw information
from other sources during inference, such as web search results or an internal company
database, enabling more accurate or personalised responses.
● Deepfake: A type of AI-generated fake content, consisting of audio or visual content, that
misrepresents real people as doing or saying something that they did not actually do or say.
General-purpose AI systems rely on and can process vast amounts of personal data, posing
significant privacy risks. In the context of AI, privacy is a complex and multi-faceted concept
encompassing:
● Data confidentiality and protection of personal data collected or used for training purposes,
fine-tuning, information extraction, or during inference.
● Institutional transparency and controls over how personal information is used in AI systems
(820); for example, the ability for individuals to opt out from their personal data being
collected for training, or the post hoc ability to make a general-purpose AI system ‘unlearn’
specific information about an individual (821); and related challenges such as reconciling
data minimisation and transparency (822), control over how data-driven decisions are
made, and unauthorised use or processing of personal data (823).
● Protection from individual and collective harms that may occur as a result of data use or
malicious use. For example, the creation of deepfakes (824), challenges to the right to be
forgotten (548) or the right to correct (825), and other risks from the large-scale scraping of
personal data (826).
General-purpose AI poses various risks to privacy. These are very broadly categorised into:

● Training risks: risks related to training and the collection of data (especially sensitive data).
● Use risks: risks related to AI systems’ handling of sensitive information during use.
● Intentional harm risks: risks that malicious actors will apply general-purpose AI to harm
individual privacy (see Figure 2.11).
These risks are already present with currently available AI tools, but are exacerbated by the
increased scale of training, capacity for information processing, and ease of use presented by
general-purpose AI.
General-purpose AI systems may expose their training data (‘Training Risks’). The training of
general-purpose AI models generally requires large amounts of data. Academic studies have shown
that some of this training data may be memorised by general-purpose AI models (827, 828),
enabling users to infer information about individuals whose data was collected (829, 830, 831) or to
even reconstruct entire training examples (832, 833, 834, 835). However, definitions of
memorisation vary, so it is challenging to make concrete claims about the harms that might arise
from memorisation (827). Many systems are trained on publicly available data containing personal
information without the knowledge or consent of the individuals it pertains to, in addition to training

on proprietary web content owned by media distributors (826, 836). This extends to cases where
one person posts personal information about another person online – for example, Facebook posts
including pictures and information about a person’s peers or friends without explicit consent from
those peers. In specific domains, training on sensitive data (such as medical or financial data) is
often necessary to improve performance in that domain but could result in serious privacy leaks.
These risks can be reduced – for example, existing medical general-purpose AI systems such as
Google’s Gemini-Med (837*) are only trained on anonymised or pseudonymised public patient data
– but more research is needed to assess the risks associated with this. Privacy-preserving training
approaches or synthetic data may help address this, as discussed in 3.4.3. Technical methods for
privacy.
Figure 2.11: Risks to privacy from general-purpose AI fall into three risk groups: 1. Training risks: risks associated with
training on sensitive data, 2. Use risks: risks related to handling sensitive information during the use of general-purpose
AI, and 3. Intentional harm risks: risks from malicious actors applying general-purpose AI to compromise individual
privacy. Source: International AI Safety Report.

Information used during the application of general-purpose AI can be leaked, such as private data
used to personalise responses (‘Use Risks’). General-purpose AI models do not have knowledge of
current affairs occurring after their training or knowledge of private information not included in the
training data. To address this, it is common practice to provide relevant contextualising information
to AI systems during usage through so-called ‘Retrieval-Augmented Generation’ (RAG) (838, 839,
840). This process can also allow for personalised responses using private personal data, for
example, with personal assistant AIs on phones (4*, 841*). It can also be used to include external
information, such as web search results (85*), in the context used to provide a response. These can
be combined; for example, a healthcare AI support tool may include or access sensitive medical
records about an individual and then search the web or medical databases for relevant information

before providing a response to support a clinician. While the use of on-device private data can
make general-purpose AI more useful, it can create additional risks of leaking this data. Risks of
information leakage to third parties increase substantially when data (or insights from the data)
leave a device (842, 843), although cybersecurity approaches can minimise these risks (844). In
practice, balancing privacy, user transparency, and consumer utility in this context is a difficult
challenge; technical approaches to balance this exist (see 3.4.3. Technical methods for privacy), but
it is also important to find policy approaches that safeguard rights, enable transparency, and create
trust for data sharing to promote innovation.
General-purpose AI systems could enable increased privacy abuse by malicious actors (‘Intentional
Harm Risks’). There are many scenarios relevant to privacy risk in which malicious users may exploit
AI’s increased information processing capabilities. For example, fine-grained internet-wide search
capabilities, such as powerful reverse image search or forms of writing style detection, allow
individuals to be identified and tracked across online platforms, and sensitive personal
characteristics can be inferred (483*, 845) (such as gender, race, medical conditions, or personal
preferences), further eroding individual privacy (846). LLMs can enable more efficient and effective
searches for sensitive information in data. Detection, redaction, or sanitisation of personally
identifiable information alone is insufficient to fully mitigate inference of sensitive personal content:
many user attributes, such as detailed sexual preferences or specific drug use habits, can often still
be found from ‘redacted’ data (847), although AI systems may also be useful in supporting the
monitoring and removal of sensitive information online. These risks can arise across many contexts,
and may result in broad unauthorised processing of personal data. This includes risks associated
with the ability of general-purpose AI systems to infer private information based on model inputs
(316*, 483*). Beyond analysis and search, general-purpose AI content generated using private data,
such as non-consensual deepfakes, can be used to manipulate or harm individuals. This raises
concerns about the harm caused by the malicious use of personal data and the erosion of trust in
online content (see 2.1.1. Harm to individuals through fake content for a more detailed discussion).
Since the publication of the Interim Report, the increased prominence and capabilities of
general-purpose AI have led to its increased use in sensitive contexts and subsequent
scrutiny of its possible violations of privacy laws. General-purpose AI is now more common in
contexts with sensitive data, such as personal devices with smart assistants (4*, 841*) and
healthcare (848*). So far, no major AI vendors have reported high-profile leaks of user or
commercial information, which is meaningful given that disclosures of data breaches of
personal information are required in most jurisdictions. In addition, researchers have not
found evidence of explicit privacy violations using general-purpose AI. However, unlike other
harms, some forms of privacy violations can remain hidden for long periods of time. For
example, privacy harms from training on sensitive data may not become realised for an
extended period after training, since the time between the collection or use of data and the
subsequent deployment of an AI system may be substantial. Regulators are increasingly
enforcing privacy laws to protect consumers from companies that use AI without privacy
controls or safeguards (849, 850). Meanwhile, new modalities of interactions with 
Risks
 2.3 Systemic risks
143
general-purpose AI create new risks to privacy. For example, high-quality video generation
models (851*) may be capable of memorising video information (such as faces of students in
live-streamed classrooms) or of being used to exploit privacy by reasoning over video data
(852*) or through speaker identification (3*) (for example, using general-purpose AI to watch
individuals and automatically take notes on their behaviour). Other concerns about privacy
from downstream consequences of general-purpose AI have also emerged. For example, in
the future there may be a need to differentiate humans from capable general-purpose AI
online, which could make mass identification and subsequent online surveillance more likely
(853).
The main evidence gaps around privacy include when private information can be
unintentionally leaked, how to prevent it, and what the societal consequences of
general-purpose AI could mean for privacy. It is challenging to assess how much
general-purpose AI memorises its training data and how likely it is to regurgitate that data (171,
831). Similarly, ongoing research seeks to determine the extent to which general-purpose AI
can or will keep information provided during use private (847). More broadly, research is
needed into the long-term consequences for privacy that may arise from the widespread use
of general-purpose AI, including the risks of actors correctly inferring sensitive information
about individuals using general-purpose AI (483*), the risks of enhanced mass surveillance
(439, 483*), and the consequences of prevalent general-purpose AI on privacy and identity
(853).
For policymakers working on privacy, key challenges will include assessing the extent and
impact of privacy violations from and via general-purpose AI. Knowing when and how privacy
is violated is inherently challenging for both individuals and policymakers (854), with risks
across multiple aspects of development and use (summarised in Figure 2.11). Often,
unauthorised processing of personal data occurs or sensitive information is leaked without
noticeable harm to the individual in the short term, making it difficult to gain support to
address privacy risks pre-emptively (855*). When sensitive information is leaked, it can also
be hard to audit where the leakage occurred in the technical systems underpinning
general-purpose AI, as data is often handled across multiple devices or in different parts of
the supply chain. For policymakers, both of these can make it extremely difficult to see the
scale or scope of privacy violations, which in turn can make it difficult to determine the proper
type and magnitude of intervention. Balancing privacy risks with the utility of general-purpose
AI systems will be challenging but possible, with more research needed to assess risks and
minimise harms.

2.3.6. Risks of copyright infringement

KEY INFORMATION

● The use of vast amounts of data for training general-purpose AI models has caused
concerns related to data rights and intellectual property. Data collection and content
generation can implicate a variety of data rights laws, which vary across jurisdictions and
may be under active litigation. Given the legal uncertainty around data collection
practices, AI companies are sharing less information about the data they use. This opacity
makes third-party AI safety research harder.
● AI content creation challenges traditional systems of data consent, compensation, and
control. Intellectual property laws are designed to protect and promote creative
expression and innovation. General-purpose AI both learns from and can create works of
creative expression.
● Researchers are developing tooling and methods to mitigate the risks of potential
copyright infringement and other data rights laws, but these remain unreliable. There are
also limited tools to source and filter training data at scale according to their licences,
affirmative consent from the creators, or other legal and ethical criteria.
● Since the Interim Report (May 2024), data rights holders have been rapidly restricting
access to their data. This prevents AI developers from using this data to train their models,
but also hinders access to the data for research, social good, or non-AI purposes.
● Policymakers face the challenge of enabling responsible and legally compliant data access
without discouraging data sharing and innovation. Technical tools to evaluate, trace, filter,
and automatically license data could make this much easier, but current tools are not
sufficiently scalable and effective.

Key Definitions

● Intellectual property: Creations of the mind over which legal rights may be granted, including
literary and artistic works, symbols, names and images.
● Copyright: A form of legal protection granted to creators of original works, giving them
exclusive rights to use, reproduce, and distribute their work.
● Trademark: A symbol, word, or phrase legally registered or established by use to represent a
company or product, distinguishing it from others in the market.
● Likeness rights: Rights that protect an individual's image, voice, name, or other identifiable
aspects from unauthorised commercial use.
● Fair use: An American legal doctrine that provides a defence to copyright infringement
claims for limited uses of copyrighted materials without permission for purposes such as
criticism, comment, news reporting, education, and research. Some other countries allow
similar use rights under the name ‘fair dealing’.

transparency, web crawling, and the norms of sharing information on the web. Source: International AI Safety Report.

General-purpose AI trains on large data collections, which can implicate a variety of data rights
laws, including intellectual property, privacy, trademarks, and image/likeness rights.
General-purpose AI is trained on large data collections, often sourced in part from the internet.
They can be used to generate text, images, audio, or videos that can sometimes emulate the
content they were trained on. In both the case of data collection (inputs) and data generation
(outputs), these systems may implicate various data rights and laws (see Figure 2.12). For instance,
if AI training data contains personally identifiable information, it can engender privacy concerns.
Similarly, web-sourced training datasets frequently contain copyrighted material, implicating
copyright and intellectual property laws (836, 856). If brands are captured in the data, trademarks
may also be implicated. In some jurisdictions, famous individuals featured in training data may have
likeness rights (857). The laws governing these data rights may also vary across jurisdictions and,
especially in the case of AI, some are actively being litigated.
Copyright laws aim to protect creative expression; general-purpose AI both learns from and
generates content resembling creative expression. Copyright laws aim to protect and encourage
written and creative expression (858, 859), primarily in the forms of literary works (including
software), visual arts, music, sound recordings, and audio-visual works. They grant the creators of
original works the exclusive right to copy, distribute, adapt, and perform their own work. The
unauthorised third-party use of copyrighted data is permissible in certain jurisdictions and
circumstances: for instance on the basis of the ‘fair use’ exception in the US (860), by the ‘text and
data mining’ exception in the EU (861), by the amended Copyright Act in Japan (862), under Israeli
copyright law (863), and by the Copyright Act 2021 in Singapore (864). In each jurisdiction there are
different laws related to (a) the permissibility of data collection practices (e.g. data scraping), (b)
the use of the data (e.g. for training AI, commercial, or non-commercial systems), and (c) whether

model outputs that appear similar to copyrighted material are infringing. In the US, these questions
are actively litigated (865, 866, 867, 868, 869), for example in cases such as the New York Times
versus OpenAI and Microsoft. Many issues related to dataset creation and use across the dataset’s
lifecycle make copyright concerns for training AI models very complicated (870). Relevant
questions include whether datasets were assembled specifically for machine learning or originally
for other purposes (871), whether the potential infringement applies to model inputs and/or model
outputs (872, 873, 874), and which jurisdiction the case falls under, among others (481). There are
also questions around who is liable for infringement or harmful model outputs (developers, users, or
other actors) (875). While developers can use technical strategies to mitigate the risks of copyright
infringement from model outputs, these risks are difficult to eliminate entirely (876, 877).
General-purpose AI systems may impact creative and publisher economies. As general-purpose AI
systems become more capable, they increasingly have the potential to disrupt labour markets, and
in particular creative industries (662, 707) (also see 2.3.1. Labour market risks). Pending legal
decisions regarding copyright infringement in the AI training phase may affect general-purpose AI
developers’ ability to build powerful and performant models by limiting their access to training data
(836, 856, 878). They may also impact data creators’ ability to limit the uses of their data, which
may disincentivise creative expression. For instance, news publishers and artists have voiced
concerns that their customers might use generative AI systems to provide them with similar
content. In news, art and entertainment domains, generative AI can often produce paraphrased,
abstracted, or summarised versions of the content it has trained on. If users access news through
generative AI summaries rather than from media sites, this could reduce subscription and
advertising revenues for the original publishers. Reduced subscriptions can equate to copyright
damages.
Legal uncertainty around data collection practices has disincentivised transparency around what
data developers of general-purpose AI have collected or used, making third-party AI safety
research harder. Independent AI researchers can more easily understand the potential risks and
harms of a general-purpose AI system if there is transparency about the data it was trained on
(879). For instance, it is much more tractable to quantify the risk of a model generating biased,
copyrighted, or private information if the researcher knows what data sources it was trained on.
However, this type of transparency is often lacking for major general-purpose AI developers (880).
Fear of legal risk, especially over copyright infringement, disincentivises AI developers from
disclosing their training data (881).
The infrastructure to source and filter for legally permissible data is under-developed, making it
hard for developers to comply with copyright law. The permissibility of using copyrighted works as
part of training data without appropriate authorisation is an active area of litigation. Tools to source
and identify available data without copyright concerns are limited. For instance, recent work shows
that around 60% of popular datasets in the most widely used openly accessible dataset
repositories have incorrect or missing licence information (481). Similarly, there are limitations to
the current tools for discerning copyright-free data in web scrapes (856, 878). However, 
Risks
 2.3 Systemic risks
147
practitioners are developing new standards for data documentation and new protocols for data
creators to signal their consent for use in training AI models (882, 883).

Since the publication of the Interim Report, the legal and technical struggles over data have
escalated, and research suggests that it remains difficult to completely prevent models from
generating copyrighted material using technical mitigations. Many organisations, including AI
developers, use automatic bots called ‘web crawlers’ that navigate the web and copy content.
Websites often want their content to be read by crawlers that will direct human traffic to
them (such as search engine crawlers) but left alone by crawlers that will copy their data to
train competing tools (e.g. AI models that will displace their traffic). Websites can indicate
their preferences to crawlers in their code, including if and by whom they would like to be
crawled. They can also employ technologies that attempt to identify and block crawlers. Since
May 2024, evidence has emerged that websites have erected more barriers to the crawlers
from AI developers (836, 884, 885). These measures are triggered by uncertainty about
whether AI developers’ crawlers will respect websites’ preference signals. In search of
solutions, the European AI Office is developing a transparency reporting Code of Practice for
General-Purpose AI developers (886), and the US National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) has released an AI Risk Management Framework (887). Additionally, a
growing body of work studies researchers' capacity to excise information from a trained
model, or to detect what a model was trained on. However, these methods, as applied to
general-purpose AI models, still have fundamental challenges that may not be easily
overcome in the near future (831, 832, 888, 889, 890, 891, 892).
Rising barriers to accessing web content may inhibit data collection, including to non-AI
applications. Rising restrictions on web crawling result in the highest quality, well-maintained data
being less available, especially to less well-financed organisations (836, 856, 878). Declining data
availability may have ramifications for competition, for training data diversity and factuality, as well
as underserved regions’ ability to develop their own competitive AI applications. While large AI
companies may be able to afford data licences or simply develop stronger crawlers to access
restricted data, rising restrictions will have negative externalities for the other (including many
beneficial) uses of web crawlers. Many industries depend on crawlers: web search, product/price
catalogues, market research, advertising, web archives, academic research, accessibility tools, and
even security applications. These industries’ access to data is increasingly impaired due to
obstacles erected to prevent large AI developers from using data for training. Lastly, these crawler
challenges may persist, even when copyright litigation is resolved.
Tools to discover, investigate, and automatically licence data are lacking. Standardised tooling is
necessary for data creators and users to evaluate a dataset’s restrictions or limitations, to estimate
the data’s value, to automatically license it at scale, and to trace its downstream use (465, 481, 856,
878). Without these tools, the market so far has relied on ad hoc, custom contracts, without a clear
licensing process for smaller data creators. Coupled with the existing lack of data transparency
from individual developers, these shortcomings inhibit the development of an efficient and

structured data market. In essence, the web is a relatively messy, unstructured source of data.
Without better tools to organise it, developers will have difficulty avoiding training on data that may
engender legal or ethical issues.
Methods that mitigate the risk of copyright infringement in models are underdeveloped and require
more research. Large models can memorise or recall some of the data they trained on, allowing
them to reproduce it when prompted. For instance, sections from the Harry Potter books are
memorised in common language models (893*). This is desirable in some cases (e.g. recalling facts),
but undesirable in others, as it can lead to models generating and re-distributing copyrighted
material, private information, or sensitive content found on the web. There are many approaches to
mitigating this risk (see also 3.4.3. Technical methods for privacy). One is to detect whether a model
was trained on or has memorised certain undesirable content, which would enable it to also
re-generate it (831, 832, 888, 889). This is known as ‘memorisation research’ or ‘membership
inference research’. Researchers may also investigate whether model outputs can be attributed
directly to certain training data points (877, 890). Another method is to use filters that detect when
a model is generating content that is substantively similar to copyrighted material. However, it
remains challenging conceptually and technically to test whether generations are substantially
similar to copyrighted content that the model was trained on (891, 894). Lastly, researchers are
exploring methods to remove information that models have already learned, called ‘machine
unlearning’ (821, 895, 896, 897, 898). However, it may not be a viable, robust, or practical solution in
the long run (892, 897, 898). For instance, machine unlearning often does not succeed in fully
removing the targeted information from a model, and in the process it can distort the model’s other
capabilities in unforeseen ways – which makes it unappealing to commercial AI developers (892,
895, 897, 898).
Policymakers are faced with the challenge of enabling protection of intellectual property and
other rights in data, while creating an environment that encourages data sharing to promote
innovation. These challenges are exacerbated by the many applicable laws, which vary across
jurisdictions or are actively litigated. They are also complicated by the lack of existing data
transparency in AI development, and the wave of data rights holders resorting to their own
measures to protect their data. Altogether, the web ecosystem and supply chain for data is
rapidly changing in response to AI, with or without legal interventions. These trends
demonstrate the challenges to incentivising greater transparency and developing technical
solutions that enable a healthier market for data. Without such solutions, a lack of
transparency into data use will inhibit AI safety research, negatively impact creative
economies, and spur more data protectionism, with consequences beyond AI development.

on AI risks
KEY INFORMATION

● How an AI model is released to the public is an important factor in evaluating the risks it
poses. There is a spectrum of model release options, from fully closed to fully open, all of
which involve trade-offs between risks and benefits. Open-weight models – those with
weights made publicly available for download – represent one key point on this spectrum.
● Open-weight models facilitate research and innovation while also enabling malicious uses
and perpetuating some flaws. Open weights allow global research communities to both
advance capabilities and address model flaws by providing them with direct access to a
critical AI component that is prohibitively expensive for most actors to develop
independently. However, the open release of model weights could also pose risks of
facilitating malicious or misguided use or perpetuating model flaws and biases.
● Once model weights are available for public download, there is no way to implement a
wholesale rollback of all existing copies of the model. This is because various actors will
have made their own copies. Even if retracted from hosting platforms, existing
downloaded versions are easy to distribute offline. For example, state-of-the-art models
such as Llama-3.1-405B can fit on a USB stick.
● Since the Interim Report (May 2024), high-level consensus has emerged that risks posed
by greater AI openness should be evaluated in terms of ‘marginal risk’. This refers to the
additional risk associated with releasing AI openly, compared to risks posed by closed
models or existing technology.
● Whether a model is open or closed, risk mitigation approaches need to be implemented
throughout the AI life cycle, including during data collection, model pre-training,
fine-tuning, and post-release measures. Using multiple mitigations can bolster imperfect
interventions.
● A key challenge for policymakers centres on the evidence gaps surrounding the potential
for both positive and negative impacts of open weight release on market concentration
and competition. The effects will likely vary depending on how openly the model is
released (e.g. whether release is under an open source licence), on the level of market
being discussed (i.e. competition between general-purpose AI developers vs. downstream
application developers), and based on the size of the gap between competitors.
● Another key challenge for policymakers is in recognising the technical limitations of
certain policy interventions for open models. For example, requirements such as robust
watermarking for open-weight generative AI models are currently infeasible, as there are
technical limitations to implementing watermarks that cannot be removed.

● Open-weight model: An AI model whose weights are publicly available for download, such as

● Open source model: An AI model that is released for public download under an open source

model for any purpose. There remains some disagreement as to which model components
(weights, code, training data) and documentation must be publicly accessible for the model
to qualify as open source.
● Weights: Model parameters that represent the strength of connection between nodes in a
neural network. Weights play an important part in determining the output of a model in
response to a given input and are iteratively updated during model training to improve its
performance.
● Deepfake: A type of AI-generated fake content, consisting of audio or visual content, that
misrepresents real people as doing or saying something that they did not actually do or say.
This section primarily focuses on the benefits and risks of general-purpose AI models with widely
available model weights. Model weights, also known as parameters, are the numbers used to specify
how the input (e.g. text describing an image) is transformed into the output (e.g. the image itself).
These weights are iteratively updated during model training to improve the model’s performance on
the tasks for which it is trained (see 1.1. How general-purpose AI is developed). While realising the
full benefits of AI openness requires more openness than sharing model weights alone (for example,
this requires shared training data, training code, documentation, etc.), many of the risks associated
with open model release arise from model weights being made openly available (899). Accordingly,
open-weight models are the focus of much policy work.
The difference between ‘open-weight’ models and ‘open source’ models can be confusing.
‘Open-weight’ means that the model’s weights are available for public download such as with
Llama, Mixtral, or Hunyuan-Large. Open-weight models can be, but are not necessarily, open
source. The ‘open source’ classification requires that access to the model is protected under an
open source licence which grants legal freedom for anyone to use, study, modify, and share the
model for any purpose. Open source licences are important for realising the benefits of AI
openness: they promote innovation and counter market concentration by large tech companies by
allowing downstream developers to use, study, and modify open models without having to ask
permission, and to embed those models in products that they can place on the market. This
includes benefits to low-resource actors who could otherwise not obtain access to model weights,
since they are costly to train from scratch. While the open source licence is essential to open

151
source model classification, there remains some disagreement as to the extent to which different
components (weights, code, training data) and documentation must be publicly accessible for the
model to qualify as open source.
There is also a spectrum of model release options from fully closed to fully open, all of which
involve trade-offs between risks and benefits (see Table 2.5).

● Fully open models are open source models for which weights, full code, training data, and
other documentation (e.g. about the model’s training process) are made publicly available,
without restrictions on modification, use and sharing. In general, fully open model release
facilitates broader research and innovation but increases risks of malicious use by making it
easy for malicious actors to bypass safety restrictions and modify the model for harmful
purposes, and by increasing the likelihood of model flaws proliferating downstream into
modified model versions and applications if downstream users do not proactively update
the model version they use.
● Fully closed models’ weights and code are proprietary, for internal use only. This means that
external actors are not able to misuse the model and flaws are less likely to proliferate
downstream and can be fixed once discovered. However, with closed models it is also
harder for external developers to discover misuse risks, flaws, and use the model for wider
innovation and research.
● Partially open models share some combination of weights, code, and data under various
licences or access controls, in an attempt to balance the benefits of openness against risk
mitigation and proprietary concerns. For example, OpenAI provides public access to its
GPT-4o model through an interface called ChatGPT that allows users to prompt the system
and retrieve responses without accessing the model itself. This kind of partial ‘query access’
allows the public to use the model and study its behaviour and performance flaws without
providing direct access to the model weights and code. The cost of this partial access is
that external AI researchers (academia and third-party evaluators) do not have access to
perform deeper analysis of system safety, and downstream developers cannot freely
integrate the model into new applications and products. Some licences such as RAIL
(Responsible AI License) articulate restrictions against harmful uses of the model. Licence
restrictions are legal articulations only and provide no physical barrier to misuse if the model
itself is available for public download. Some actors may be deterred from misuse by the
potential of legal liability, while other malicious actors may simply ignore the licence
condition.

There are benefits to greater AI openness, including facilitating innovation, improving AI safety and
oversight, increasing accessibility, and allowing AI tools to be tailored to diverse needs. Training a
general-purpose AI model (the process of producing model weights) is extremely expensive. For
example, training Google’s Gemini model is estimated to have cost $191 million in compute costs
alone (731). The cost of training compute for the most expensive single general-purpose AI model is
projected to exceed $1 billion by 2027 (27). Training costs, therefore, present an insurmountable
barrier for many actors (companies, academics, and states) to participating in the general-purpose
AI marketplace and benefiting from AI applications. Openly releasing weights makes
general-purpose AI more accessible to actors who might otherwise lack the resources to develop
them independently. This reduces reliance on proprietary systems controlled by a few large
technology companies (or potentially nation states), and allows developers to fine-tune existing

 2.4 Impact of open-weight general-purpose AI models on AI risks

153
general-purpose AI weights to serve more diverse needs. For example, developers from minority
language groups can fine-tune open-weight models with specific language data sets to improve
the model’s performance in that language. Models can also be fine-tuned more freely to perform
better at specific tasks, such as writing professional legal texts, medical notes, or creative writing.
Furthermore, greater openness enables a wider and more diverse community of developers and
researchers to appraise models and identify and work to remedy vulnerabilities, which can help
facilitate greater AI safety and accelerate beneficial AI innovation. In general, the more open a
model is – including whether there is access to additional AI components beyond model weights,
such as training data, code, documentation, and the compute infrastructure required to utilise
these models – the greater the benefit for innovation and safety oversight.

Risks posed by open-weight models are largely related to enabling malicious or misguided use
(899, 901, 902). General-purpose AI models are dual-use, meaning that they can be used for good
or put to nefarious purposes. Open-model weights can potentially exacerbate misuse risks by
allowing a wide range of actors who do not have the resources and knowledge to build a model on
their own to leverage and augment existing capabilities for malicious purposes and without
oversight. While both open-weight and closed models can have safeguards to refuse user requests,
these safeguards are easier to remove for open models. For example, even if an open-weight model
has safeguards built in, such as content filters or limited training data sets, access to model weights
and inference code allows malicious actors to circumvent those safeguards (903). Furthermore,
model vulnerabilities found in open models can also expose vulnerabilities in closed models (904*).
Finally, with access to model weights, malicious actors can also fine-tune a model to optimise its
performance for harmful applications (905, 906, 907). Potential malicious uses include harmful
dual-use science applications, e.g. using AI to discover new chemical weapons (2.1.4. Biological and
chemical attacks), cyberattacks (2.1.3. Cyber offence), and producing harmful fake content such as
‘deepfake’ sexual abuse material (2.1.1. Harm to individuals through fake content) and political fake
news (2.1.2. Manipulation of public opinion). As noted below, releasing an open-weight model with
the potential for malicious use is generally not reversible even when its risks are discovered later.
There is also a risk of perpetuating flaws through open-weight releases, though openness also
allows far more actors to perform deeper technical analysis to spot these flaws and biases. When
general-purpose AI models are released openly and integrated into a multitude of downstream
systems and applications, any unresolved model flaws – such as embedded biases and
discrimination (2.2.2. Bias), vulnerabilities to adversarial attack (904*), or the ability to trick
post-deployment monitoring systems by having learned how to ‘beat the test’ (2.2.3. Loss of
control) – are distributed as well (902). The same challenge is true of closed, hosted, or API access
models, but for these non-downloadable models the model host can universally roll out new model
versions to fix vulnerabilities and flaws. For open-weight models, developers can make updated
versions available, but there is no guarantee that downstream developers will adopt the updates.
On the other hand, open-weight models can be scrutinised and tested more deeply by a larger
number of researchers and downstream developers which helps to identify and rectify more flaws
in future releases (908). 
Risks
 2.4 Impact of open-weight general-purpose AI models on AI risks

154
Since the publication of the Interim Report, high-level consensus has emerged that risks posed
by greater AI openness should be evaluated in terms of marginal risk (901, 909, 910). ‘Marginal
risk’ refers to the added risk of releasing AI openly compared to risks posed by existing
alternatives, such as closed models or other technologies (911). Studies that assess marginal
risk are often called ‘uplift studies’. Early studies indicated, for instance, that chatbots from
2023 did not significantly heighten biosecurity risks compared to existing technologies:
participants with internet access but no general-purpose AI were able to obtain
bioweapon-related information at similar rates to participants with access to AI (393) (see
2.1.4. Biological and chemical attacks for further discussion on current AI and biorisk and 3.3.
Risk identification and assessment for discussion of uplift studies and other risk assessments).
On the other hand, several studies have shown that the creation of NCII and CSAM has
increased significantly due to the open release of image-generation models such as Stable
Diffusion (912*, 913) (see 2.1.1. Harm to individuals through fake content). Attending to marginal
risk is important to ensure that interventions are proportional to the risk posed (393, 911).
However, in order to conduct marginal risk analysis, companies or regulators must first
establish a stable tolerable risk threshold (see 3.1. Risk management overview) against which
marginal risk can be compared in order to avoid a ‘boiling frog’ scenario (910). Even if an
incremental improvement in model capability increases marginal risk only slightly compared to
pre-existing technology, layering minor marginal risk upon minor marginal risk indefinitely could
add up to a substantial increase in risk over time and inadvertently lead to the release of an
unacceptably dangerous technology. In contrast, improving societal resilience and enhancing
defensive capabilities could help keep marginal risk low even as model capabilities and ‘uplift’
advance.

A key evidence gap is around whether open-weight releases for general-purpose AI will have
a positive or negative impact on competition and market concentration. Publicly releasing
model weights can lead to both positive and negative impacts on competition, market
concentration, and control (901, 910, 914, 915). In the short term, open-weight model sharing
protected under an open source licence empowers smaller downstream developers by
granting access to sophisticated technologies that they could not otherwise afford to create,
fostering innovation and diversifying the application landscape. A €1 billion investment in
many types of open source software (OSS) in the EU in 2018 is estimated to have yielded a
€65–€95 billion economic impact (916). A similar impact might be expected from
open-weight AI released under open source licence. However, this apparent democratisation
of AI may also play a role in reinforcing the dominance and market concentration (2.3.3.
Market concentration and single points of failure) among major players (914, 915). In the longer
term, companies that release open-weight general-purpose AI models often see their
frameworks become industry standards, shaping the direction of future developments, as is
quickly becoming the case with the widespread use of Llama models in open development
projects and industry application. These firms can then easily integrate advancements made
by the community (for free) back into their own offerings, maintaining their competitive edge.
Furthermore, the broader open source development ecosystem serves as a fertile recruiting

 2.4 Impact of open-weight general-purpose AI models on AI risks

155
ground, allowing companies to identify and attract skilled professionals who are already
familiar with their technologies (914). It is likely that open-weight release will affect market
concentration differently at different layers of the general-purpose AI ecosystem; it is more
likely to increase competition and reduce market concentration in downstream application
development, but at the upstream model development level, the direction of the effect is
more uncertain (750). More research is needed to clarify the technical and economic
dynamics at play.
Once model weights are available for public download, there is no way to implement a wholesale
rollback of all existing copies. Internet hosting platforms such as GitHub and Hugging Face can
remove models from their platforms, making it difficult for some actors to find downloadable copies
and providing a sufficient barrier to many casual malicious users looking for an easy way to cause
harm (917). However, a well-motivated actor would still be able to obtain an open-model copy
despite the inconvenience; even large models are easy to distribute online and off. For example,
state-of-the-art models such as Llama-3.1-405B can fit on a USB stick, underscoring the difficulty
of controlling distribution once models are openly released.
Technical solutions to reduce risks from open-weight release are still emerging and often involve
significant trade-offs against the benefits of fully open models. For example, ‘retrieval models’
enable developers to partition ‘safe’ and ‘unsafe’ capabilities, potentially allowing non-dangerous
parts of a model to be openly released while restricting dangerous capabilities. However, these
models face challenges such as contextual rigidity and require access to source data (918). Other
techniques are being developed to mitigate misuse by reducing model performance when the
weights are tampered with (919, 920, 921, 922, 923, 924). However, these current methods are
nascent and suffer from major trade-offs with efficiency, stability, and performance on benign
tasks. Establishing benchmarks and improving techniques for tamper-resistant ‘unlearning’ remains
an ongoing challenge, as discussed in 3.4.1. Training more trustworthy models.
There are risk mitigation approaches for open-weight models throughout the AI life cycle. The
most robust risk mitigation strategies will aim to address potential issues at every stage (see 3.1.
Risk management overview), from data collection and model training to fine-tuning and
post-release measures such as vulnerability disclosure (telling users when a model flaw has been
found) (910, 925). Even if model weights are kept completely closed, these mitigation approaches
allow developers to plan for leaks, since risk mitigations for open-weight models are likely to be
useful for leaked closed models as well. For example, the 405 billion-parameter model Llama 3.1 was
reportedly leaked to the public before its open release (926). 
Risks
 2.4 Impact of open-weight general-purpose AI models on AI risks

156
For policymakers working on regulating model release, key challenges going forward include:

● Pursuing evidence of marginal risk in areas of uncertainty. Policymakers need robust
analyses of marginal risk to understand where openness introduces significant risks and
where it does not. Most current research does not evaluate the marginal risk of open
models.
● Monitoring and anticipating how risks evolve with technological development. As AI
capabilities advance, the associated risks can (sometimes rapidly) increase (owing to
adversaries gaining access to models of higher capabilities) or decrease (owing to more
reliable AI or better defences being created using AI), requiring ongoing assessment and
adaptation of policies (see also 1.3. Capabilities in coming years).
● Recognising that certain policy interventions cannot be enforced for open models due to
technical limitations. For example, requiring watermarking for language models cannot be
enforced for open models, as there are technical limitations to implementing watermarks
that cannot be removed.
● Being cognisant of what interventions are technically feasible and how open release
affects these interventions. For example, technical interventions or restrictions on
fine-tuning general-purpose AI models are infeasible for open-weight AI models.
● Analysing the positive and negative impact of regulating model release. Open-weight AI
models have strong benefits in transparency, competition, and concentration – at least in
some parts of the AI ecosystem.
● Trading off marginal risks with marginal benefits. It is important to develop frameworks for
making decisions about the regulation of open-weight AI models. These frameworks are
likely to be context-dependent, and there is no single correct answer: different parties,
institutions, and governments will reach different conclusions based on their priorities and
the specifics of the model and release mechanism being considered.

KEY INFORMATION

● Risk management – identifying and assessing risks, and then mitigating and monitoring
them – is challenging in the context of general-purpose AI. While numerous frameworks
and practices are under development globally, significant gaps remain in validation,
standardisation, and implementation across sectors and jurisdictions, particularly for
identifying and mitigating unprecedented risks.
● The context of general-purpose AI risk management is uniquely complex due to the
technology’s rapid evolution and broad applicability. Traditional risk management
practices (such as safety by design, audits, redundancy, and safety cases) provide a
foundation, but must be adapted given the rapid evolution, broad applicability, and
complex interaction effects of general-purpose AI.
● A ‘system safety’ approach is helpful for managing general-purpose AI risks effectively.
This approach applies both engineering and management principles to identify and control
hazards throughout a system’s life cycle. For general-purpose AI, this includes
understanding the interactions between the hardware and software components,
organisational structures, and human factors.
● A 'defence in depth' strategy has emerged as a prominent technical approach. This
strategy of layering multiple protective measures is common in fields including nuclear
safety and infectious disease control. It is being adapted for general-purpose AI systems
throughout their lifecycle, with different roles for data providers, infrastructure providers,
developers, and users.
● Current evidence points to two central challenges in general-purpose AI risk management.
First, it is difficult to prioritise risks due to uncertainty about their severity and likelihood of
occurrence. Second, it can be complex to determine appropriate roles and responsibilities
across the AI value chain, and to incentivise effective action.

Key Definitions

● Risk: The combination of the probability and severity of a harm that arises from the
development, deployment, or use of AI.
● Hazard: Any event or activity that has the potential to cause harm, such as loss of life, injury,
social disruption, or environmental damage.
● Risk management: The systematic process of identifying, evaluating, mitigating and
monitoring risks.
● Defence in depth: A strategy that includes layering multiple risk mitigation measures in
cases where no single existing method can provide safety.
● Capabilities: The range of tasks or functions that an AI system can perform, and how
competently it can perform them. 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.1 Risk management overview
159
● Deployment: The process of implementing AI systems into real-world applications, products,
or services where they can serve requests and operate within a larger context.
● Modalities: The kinds of data that an AI system can competently receive as input and
produce as output, including text (language or code), images, video, and robotic actions.
Risk management challenges

Early stages of the risk management process include risk identification and assessment, which are
challenging and benefit from diverse expertise. These topics are addressed in detail in 3.3. Risk
identification and assessment, but are critical to keep in mind for overarching risk management
because of their unique challenges and the ways that they influence all subsequent elements of risk
management. It is critical to identify and assess the risks of general-purpose AI from the earliest
design stages and not merely after a model is developed. This can be facilitated by the use of
comprehensive risk taxonomies and typologies, which categorise and organise a large number of
risks. Later stages of the risk management process, including prioritisation and mitigation, are
addressed throughout 3. Technical approaches to risk management, as well as in the table of risk
management practices below.
Risk identification and assessment remain challenging because general-purpose AI can be applied
across many different domains and contexts, and capabilities (and associated risks) change over
time. AI may pose very different risks when applied, for example, in healthcare (where accuracy is
critical) and in creative writing (where it is not). Moreover, studies show that the performance of
general-purpose AI systems can change over time as it can be significantly improved through
relatively simple measures without expensive retraining. Addressing this may require regularly
updated risk assessments (77). For example, fine-tuning models (e.g. providing them with small
amounts of highly curated additional training data) can significantly enhance their capabilities in
specific domains (927), with implications for risk discussed in 2.1.4. Biological and chemical attacks.
Some risks may not be predictable, and will result from complex interactions between models,
people, organisations, and social and political systems (172).
To better inform risk management practices, there is a need for evaluations that focus on a broader
set of risks from general-purpose AI, not just capabilities, and for improved evaluations across
languages, cultures, modalities, and use cases. As discussed in 3.3. Risk identification and
assessment, there have been recent advances in evaluation methods, including the MLCommons AI
Safety benchmark, which measures the safety of large language models (LLMs) by assessing
models’ responses to prompts across multiple hazard categories including child sexual exploitation,
indiscriminate weapons, and suicide and self-harm (457). The Sociotechnical Safety Evaluation
Repository includes many additional benchmarks and evaluation methods that can help developers
and evaluators assess societal risks from LLMs and other generative AI systems (928*). However,
the space is missing a broader focus on the science of evaluation. Current evaluations focus largely
on the general-purpose AI model itself, glossing over the various system designs, use cases, user
audiences, and other contextual factors that heavily influence how risk may manifest. Many also

focus on text modalities and may be less relevant for other modalities (such as images and audio)
or for multimodal systems (929*). They also struggle to accurately assess risk across the world
because, for example, they only evaluate in English based on a Western cultural context, but the
model may be designed to be a multilingual system (930*). Improving benchmarks for models in
low-resource languages requires collaboration between researchers, native speakers, and
community partners such as language activists and educators (931).
Broad participation and engagement are required to assess and manage the risks of
general-purpose AI; it cannot be left in the hands of the scientific community alone. Effectively
managing the risks of highly capable general-purpose AI systems requires the involvement of
multiple groups, including experts from multiple domains and impacted communities, to identify
and assess high-priority risks. Even ’risk’ and ‘safety’ are contentious concepts – for instance, they
leave open whose safety is being considered – and assessing them requires the involvement of
diverse sets of experts and impacted populations (537). It is common for AI risk management
frameworks to recommend participatory methods, including engagement with a broad set of
relevant groups throughout the AI lifecycle; participatory approaches can be challenging to
implement in the face of various power dynamics (932).
Risk management mechanisms and practices
There are numerous practices and mechanisms that can help manage the broad range of risks
posed by general-purpose AI. Some of these are referenced in Table 3.1 below; they are discussed
throughout 3. Technical approaches to risk management in more detail.
Table 3.1 below includes risk management practices that support five (interconnected) stages of
risk management:
● Risk identification: The process of finding, recognising, and describing risks.
● Risk assessment: The process to understand the nature of risk and to determine the level of
risk.
● Risk evaluation: The process of comparing the results of risk assessment with risk criteria to
determine whether the risk and/or its magnitude is/are acceptable or tolerable. (Note that
the term ‘evaluation’ has multiple meanings in the context of AI and can also refer to testing
models.)
● Risk mitigation: Prioritising, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-reducing
controls/countermeasures recommended from the risk management process.
● Risk governance: The process by which risk management evaluation, decisions, and actions
are connected to enterprise strategy and objectives. Risk governance provides the
transparency, responsibility, and accountability that enables managers to acceptably
manage risk.

AI companies (954, 955)
Table 3.1: Several practices and mechanisms, organised by five stages of risk management, can help manage the broad
range of risks posed by general-purpose AI.

Documentation and institutional transparency mechanisms, together with information sharing
practices, play an important role in managing the risks of general-purpose AI and facilitating
external scrutiny. It has become common practice to test models before release, including via
red-teaming and benchmarking, and to publish the results in a ‘model card’ or ‘system card’ along
with basic details about the model, including how it was trained and what its limitations are (34,
51*). Another approach that can support greater levels of institutional transparency is publishing
Foundation Model Transparency Reports or making public a similar degree of documentation (956).
Other important elements of documentation and transparency include monitoring and incident
reporting (44*, 957*), for example via the AI Incident Sharing Initiative (953); and information
sharing, which can be facilitated by industry groups such as the Frontier Model Forum,
governments, or others. Improving and standardising documentation supports greater external
scrutiny and accountability (958).
Risk tolerance and risk thresholds are especially important aspects of risk management for
general-purpose AI. It is not possible to evaluate general-purpose AI for all possible capabilities, so
organisations prioritise those that are most likely to lead to harmful outcomes above their risk
tolerance. Risk tolerance is often left up to AI developers and deployers to determine for
themselves, but policymakers can help to provide guidance and restrictions around unacceptable
risks to individuals and society. An increasingly common practice among AI developers is to 
Technical approaches to risk management

165
constrain decisions through voluntary pre-defined capabilities thresholds (594*, 947*). Such
thresholds determine that when models exhibit specific (risky) capabilities, this must be met with
specific mitigations that are meant to keep risks to an acceptable level. For example, one company
has committed to implement a series of defensive layers (‘defence in depth’) designed to prevent
misuse as soon as a model is found to “significantly assist individuals or groups with basic STEM
backgrounds in obtaining, producing, or deploying CBRN [chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear] weapons”, (947*). Such capabilities thresholds can have the advantage of being observable
and measurable to some extent. However, capabilities are only one of multiple possible ‘key risk
indicators’ and capability assessment is not a full risk assessment. Other kinds of thresholds that
are relevant for general-purpose AI include risk thresholds, which try to estimate the level of risk
directly, (944) and compute thresholds, which set thresholds in terms of the computational
resources required to train a model (943). However, important limitations remain. Compute
thresholds in particular are an unreliable proxy for risk (170*), though they have the advantage of
being easily measurable, relevant to many different risks, and known long before the risks actually
materialise. Additional criteria such as the number of private or business users, the range of
modalities an AI can handle, and the size and quality of the training data, could also play a role in
defining risk thresholds in the future (959).
AI release and deployment strategies are an additional risk management practice that can be
particularly useful for general-purpose AI. 2.4. Impact of open-weight general-purpose AI models
on AI risks discusses how the open release of model weights affects risks. There are some emerging
industry best practices that focus on release and deployment strategies for general-purpose AI
(948). Possible release strategies include releasing the model in stages to learn from real-world
evidence prior to full release, providing cloud-based or API (application programming interface)
access to have greater ability to prevent misuses, or implementing other deployment safety
controls (44*). Other approaches include using responsible AI licences and acceptable use policies
to potentially constrain misuse (960).
Risk management practices require commitment from organisational leadership and aligned
organisational incentives. Organisational culture and structure impact the effectiveness of
responsible AI initiatives and AI risk management in numerous ways (961). Some developers have
internal decision-making panels that deliberate on how to safely and responsibly design, develop,
and review new systems. Oversight and advisory committees, trusts, or AI ethics boards can
provide helpful risk management guidance and organisational oversight (962*, 963).
Lessons from other fields

Risk management strategies from other domains can be applied to general-purpose AI. Common
risk management tools in other safety-critical industries such as biosafety and nuclear safety
include planned audits and inspection, ensuring traceability using standardised documentation,
redundant defence mechanisms against critical risks and failures, safety buffers, control banding,
long-term impact assessments, ALARP (an acronym for keeping risk ‘as low as reasonably 
Technical approaches to risk management

166
practicable’), and other risk management guidelines prescribing processes, evaluations, and
deliverables at all stages of a safety-critical system’s life cycle. Human rights impact assessments
are also used across many fields to assess the human rights impacts of particular industry
practices (964), and are highly relevant for AI systems of all kinds (965). Forecasting is another
long-standing method with both benefits and shortcomings (966) that can help inform high-stakes
decisions about general-purpose AI (928*, 967). Although translating best practices from other
domains to general-purpose AI can be difficult, there is some guidance on ways it can be done
(968, 969).
Safety and reliability engineering are particularly relevant. ‘System safety engineering’ focuses on
the interactions between multiple parts of a larger system (970), and emphasises that accidents
may occur for more complex reasons than simply component failures, chains of failure events, or
deviations from operational expectations (971, 972). In the case of AI, system safety engineering
entails taking into account all the constituent parts of a general-purpose AI system, as well as the
broader context in which it operates. The practice of safety engineering has a long history in
various safety-critical engineering systems, such as aircraft flight control, engine control systems,
and nuclear reactor control. At a high level, safety engineering assures that a life-critical system
acts as intended and with minimal harm, even when certain components of the system fail.
‘Reliability engineering’ is broader in scope and addresses non-critical failures as well.
These approaches offer several techniques that are useful for risk assessment in general-purpose
AI:
● ‘Safety by design’ (SbD) is an approach that centres user safety in the design and
development of products and services. For general-purpose AI products and services, this
may take the form of minimising illegal, harmful, and dangerous content in the model training
data and evaluating for a wide range of risks prior to deployment.
● ‘Safety analysis’ delineates the causal dependencies between the functionality of individual
components and the overall system, so that component failures, which can lead to
system-level hazards (e.g. aircraft crashes or nuclear reactor core meltdowns), can be
anticipated and prevented to the extent possible. For general-purpose AI, this could mean
seeking to understand how the security practices of a model’s training data may influence
the security of the overall model.
● 'Safety of the intended function' (SOTIF) approaches require engineers to provide evidence
that the system is safe when operating as intended. SOTIF is particularly relevant to
general-purpose AI because it considers scenarios where a system might be operating
correctly but still pose a safety risk due to unforeseen circumstances.
● Some risk assessment methods, such as for the nuclear power sector, leverage
mathematical models that are designed to quantify risk as a function of various design and
engineering choices, accompanied by quantitative risk thresholds set by regulators (973).
For example, some regulatory commissions mandate that nuclear reactor operators produce
probabilistic risk assessments and ensure that the estimated risks of certain events are kept

below specified thresholds. Although this is not yet typical for general-purpose AI due to
numerous quantification challenges discussed in this report, a key advantage of this
approach is that it lets a publicly accountable body define what risk is considered
acceptable or unacceptable, in a way that is accessible to the public and external experts.
It is critical to scrutinise design choices made throughout the general-purpose AI lifecycle. The
‘pipeline-aware’ approach to mitigating AI’s harm takes inspiration from safety engineering and
proposes scrutinising numerous design choices made through the general-purpose AI lifecycle,
from ideation and problem formulation, to design, development, and deployment, both as individual
components and in relation to one another (974, 975). Further work is needed to extend these
ideas from traditional AI to general-purpose AI. For example, Assurance of Machine Learning for use
in Autonomous Systems (AMLAS) provides a methodology for integrating safety assurance into the
development of machine learning components and may also be useful for general-purpose AI (976).
‘Safety cases’ could provide a useful way for policymakers to explore hazards and risk mitigations
for general-purpose AI. Developers of safety-critical technologies such as aviation, medical
devices, and defence software are required to make ‘safety cases’, which put the burden of proof
on the developer to demonstrate that their product does not exceed maximum risk thresholds set
by the regulator (38, 949, 977, 978). A safety case is a structured argument supported by evidence,
where the developer identifies hazards, models risk scenarios, and evaluates the mitigations taken.
For example, a safety case for general-purpose AI might show that an AI system is incapable of
causing unacceptable outcomes in any realistic setting, e.g. even if the system is placed on
unmonitored servers and given access to substantial computational resources (978). Safety cases
leverage the technical expertise of the technology developer and are amenable to third-party
review, but still require that the regulator (or a suitable third party) has the technical expertise and
other resources to appropriately evaluate them. A possible limitation is that safety cases may
address only a subset of risks and threat models, leaving out important ones (979, 980). One
mitigation to this limitation is to review safety cases alongside risk cases produced by a red team
of third-party experts (978).
The ‘defence in depth’ model is helpful for general-purpose AI risk management. Multiple
independent and overlapping layers of defence against risks may be advisable, such that if one fails,
others will still be effective. This is sometimes referred to as the ‘Swiss cheese model of defence in
depth’ (981). An example of the effectiveness of the defence in depth model is the range of
preventative measures that are deployed to prevent infectious diseases: vaccines, masks, and
hand-washing, among other measures, can reduce the risk of infection substantially in combination,
even though none of these methods are 100% effective on their own (981). For general-purpose AI,
defence in depth will include controls that are not on the AI model itself, but on the broader
ecosystem, such as controls on training data (e.g. certain DNA sequences) and controls on the
materials needed to execute an attack (e.g. equipment and reagents). It is also important to
remember that methods like defence in depth are unlikely to be sufficient on their own because
they focus on preventing accidents, risks from malfunction (see 2.2. Risks from malfunctions), and 
Technical approaches to risk management

168
malicious use risks (see 2.1. Risks from malicious use), but are not generally sufficient to manage
more complex systemic risks (see 2.3. Systemic risks).
Gaps and opportunities

The main evidence gaps around risk management for general-purpose AI include how great
the risks are, and the degree to which different mechanisms can actually constrain and
mitigate risks in real-world contexts. There is not always a scientific consensus about how
likely or severe the risks of general-purpose AI systems are or will be, making it difficult for
policymakers to know whether and how they should be prioritised. For example, how to
manage misuse risk will depend on how skilled threat actors are in real-world contexts of
concern. Moreover, most of the risk management efforts described above are not yet
validated, standardised, or widely used. Risk management efforts vary across leading AI
companies and incentives may not be well-aligned to encourage thorough assessment and
management (982). While there are a few risk mitigations that are perceived to be the most
effective by experts for reducing systemic risks from general-purpose AI (983), the efficacy
of general-purpose AI risk management mechanisms is still being assessed and policymakers
should seek more evidence from real-world applications.
For policymakers working on risk management for general-purpose AI, key challenges include
knowing how to prioritise the many risks posed by general-purpose AI, and knowing who is
best-positioned to mitigate them. Risk management guidance often recommends prioritising
high-probability or high-impact concerns, including instances where significant negative
impacts are imminent or already occurring, or where catastrophic risks could be present
(887). However, it is not always clear which are the most likely or impactful risks. Moreover,
risk management necessarily involves different actors at different stages of the AI value chain,
including data and cloud providers, model developers, and model hosting platforms, each of
whom has unique opportunities and responsibilities to assess and manage risks. Policymakers
need greater clarity on how various actors’ responsibilities differ and how policy incentives
can support various risk management activities (925).

policymaking

KEY INFORMATION

Several technical properties of general-purpose AI make risk mitigation for many risks
associated with general-purpose AI difficult:

A. Autonomous general-purpose AI agents may increase risks: AI developers are making large
efforts to create and deploy general-purpose AI systems that can more effectively act and
plan in pursuit of goals. These agents are not well understood but require special attention
from policymakers. They could enable malicious uses and risks of malfunctions, such as
unreliability and loss of human control, by enabling more widespread applications with less
human oversight.
B. The breadth of use cases complicates safety assurance: General-purpose AI systems are
being used for many (often unanticipated) tasks in many contexts, making it hard to assure
their safety across all relevant use cases, and potentially allowing companies to adapt their
systems to work around regulations.
C. General-purpose AI developers understand little about how their models operate internally:
Despite recent progress, developers and scientists cannot yet explain why these models
create a given output, nor what function most of their internal components perform. This
complicates safety assurance, and it is not yet possible to provide even approximate safety
guarantees.
D. Harmful behaviours, including unintended goal-oriented behaviours, remain persistent:
Despite gradual progress on identifying and removing harmful behaviours and capabilities
from general-purpose AI systems, developers struggle to prevent them from exhibiting even
well-known overtly harmful behaviours across foreseeable circumstances, such as providing
instructions for criminal activities. Additionally, general-purpose AI systems can act in
accordance with unintended goals that can be hard to predict and mitigate.
E. An ‘evaluation gap’ for safety persists: Despite ongoing progress, current risk assessment and
evaluation methods for general-purpose AI systems are immature. Even if a model passes
current risk evaluations, it can be unsafe. To develop evaluations needed in time to meet
existing governance commitments, significant effort, time, resources, and access are needed.
F. System flaws can have a rapid global impact: When a single general-purpose AI system is
widely used across sectors, problems or harmful behaviours can affect many users
simultaneously. These impacts can manifest suddenly, such as through model updates or
initial release, and can be practically irreversible.

Key Definitions

● AI agent: A general-purpose AI which can make plans to achieve goals, adaptively perform
tasks involving multiple steps and uncertain outcomes along the way, and interact with its
environment – for example by creating files, taking actions on the web, or delegating tasks
to other agents – with little to no human oversight.
● Deployment: The process of implementing AI systems into real-world applications, products,
or services where they can serve requests and operate within a larger context.
● Evaluations: Systematic assessments of an AI system's performance, capabilities,
vulnerabilities or potential impacts. Evaluations can include benchmarking, red-teaming and
audits and can be conducted both before and after model deployment.
● Fine-tuning: The process of adapting a pre-trained AI model to a specific task or making it
more useful in general by training it on additional data.
● Goal misgeneralisation: A situation in which an AI system correctly follows an objective in its
training environment, but applies it in unintended ways when operating in a different
environment.
● Interpretability research: The study of how general-purpose AI models function internally,
and the development of methods to make this comprehensible to humans.
● Jailbreaking: Generating and submitting prompts designed to bypass guardrails and make an
AI system produce harmful content, such as instructions for building weapons.
● Open-ended domains: Environments into which AI systems might be deployed which
present a very large set of possible scenarios. In open-ended domains, developers typically
cannot anticipate and test every possible way that an AI system might be used.

response to a given input and are iteratively updated during model training to improve its
performance.
This section covers six general technical challenges that can make risk management and
policymaking more difficult for a wide range of general-purpose AI risks (see Figure 3.1).
A. Autonomous general-purpose AI agents may increase risks: general-purpose AI agents –
systems that can plan and act in the world with little to no human involvement elevate risks of
malfunctions and malicious use. Today, general-purpose AI systems are primarily used as tools by
humans. For example, a chatbot can write computer code, but a human runs, debugs, and
integrates code into a larger software project. However, researchers and developers are making
large efforts to design general-purpose AI agents – systems that can act and plan autonomously
by controlling computers, programming interfaces, robotic tools, and by delegating to other AI
systems (18, 55, 316*, 984, 985, 986*, 987, 988, 989, 990, 991*, 992). These systems are also
sometimes called ‘autonomous agents’ or ‘autonomous AI’. Researchers and developers are building

agents for a variety of domains, including web browsing (85*), research in chemistry and AI (22*,
121*, 402), software engineering (122, 259), cyber offence (127), general computer use (993, 994*,
995), and controlling robots (19*).
Figure 3.1: Technical challenges for managing general-purpose AI risks can be divided into two types: challenges with
training and evaluating systems, and challenges with deploying them. This section discusses six broad challenges that
apply to many risks. Source: International AI Safety Report.
Agentic general-purpose AI systems escalate risks by reducing human involvement and oversight.
The main purpose of general-purpose AI agents is to reduce the need for human involvement and
oversight, allowing for much faster and cheaper applications. This is economically valuable, and
increasingly agentic AI products are rapidly being developed and deployed. However, increased
delegation to AI agents reduces human oversight and can increase the risk of accidents (996) (see
2.2.1. Reliability issues). Meanwhile, agents can be uniquely vulnerable to attacks from malicious
actors (997), for example by ‘hijacking’ an agent by placing instructions in places where the agent
will encounter them (998). AI agents can also automate some workflows for malicious uses such as
scams, hacking, and the development of weapons (127, 358, 999, 1000, 1001*) (see 2.1. Risks from
malicious use for more examples). AI agents could also uniquely contribute to risks of loss of human
control if their capabilities advance significantly (see 2.2.3. Loss of control) (316*, 1002).
Furthermore, researchers have argued that it would be difficult or impossible to assure the safety
of advanced agents by relying on testing, if those agents can make long-term plans and can
distinguish testing conditions from real-world conditions (1003).
General-purpose AI agents can perform useful work autonomously but currently have limited
reliability, especially for complex tasks. Current state-of-the-art general-purpose AI systems are
capable of autonomously executing many simple tasks (e.g. writing short snippets of code), but
they struggle with more complex ones (e.g. writing entire code libraries) (122, 593, 600, 1004).

They are particularly unreliable at performing tasks that involve many steps (1005). Meanwhile,
general-purpose AI agents deployed to accomplish long-horizon tasks can be particularly
vulnerable to manipulation by malicious actors (997). The capabilities of current and future agents
are further discussed in 1.2. Current capabilities and 1.3. Capabilities in coming years.
The capabilities of general-purpose AI agents are advancing rapidly, and understanding their future
capabilities is a key evidence gap. General-purpose AI agents are rapidly becoming more capable.
For example, ‘SWE-Bench’ is a popular benchmark (metric) used to evaluate the capabilities of
agentic AI systems for software engineering tasks such as finding and fixing bugs (122). Since the
Interim Report (May 2024), top models' performance on SWE-Bench has increased from 26% to
42% (122), with the top 19 leading submissions all occurring after May 2024. This represents
dramatic progress from October 2023, when the best model achieved only 2%. Meanwhile, the
recent introduction of o1 (2*) marks a leap forward in the reasoning and problem-solving
capabilities of general-purpose AI systems. These performance improvements are due to a
combination of advances. First, as the general-purpose AI models underlying these agents become
more capable, the agents’ cognitive abilities improve. Second, these agents are being developed
with increasingly advanced training and planning methods. For example, AlphaProof, a
‘neuro-symbolic’ general-purpose AI system that combined neural networks with advanced
planning techniques, achieved silver medal-level performance on 2024 International Mathematical
Olympiad questions (187*). However, due to the rapid pace of progress in the area and the fact that
many agents are proprietary, public understanding of current state-of-the-art methods is limited.
Over the coming months and years, the development of more advanced agents demands special
attention from policymakers.
B. The breadth of use cases complicates safety assurance: general-purpose AI systems can be
applied in many unanticipated contexts, making it hard to test and assure their trustworthiness
across all realistic use cases. General-purpose AI systems’ inputs and outputs are often
open-ended, such as free-form text or image generation where users can enter any prompt. It is
not possible to study the diffuse, downstream impacts of a system in a pre-deployment laboratory
setting. This makes it challenging to make strong safety assurances because it is intractable to
exhaustively test a system in all relevant usage contexts. For example, there are thousands of
languages spoken by humans, making it very challenging to comprehensively assure the safety of
language models across languages. Since the publication of the Interim Report (May 2024),
general-purpose AI systems that can process multiple types of data (e.g. text, images, and audio)
have become increasingly common (1006). This greatly expands the set of contexts which might
cause the system to behave harmfully (1007). AI companies can readily redirect their systems'
capabilities between different applications and legal workarounds, posing challenges for targeted
intervention approaches as seen historically in financial markets (1008).
C. General-purpose AI developers understand little about how their models operate internally.
A key feature of general-purpose AI models is that their capabilities are mainly achieved through
learning rather than from top-down design: an automatic algorithm adjusts billions of numbers 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.2 General challenges for risk management and policymaking
173
(‘parameters’) millions of times until the model’s output matches the training data. As a result, the
current understanding of general-purpose AI models is more analogous to that of growing brains or
biological cells than aeroplanes or power plants. AI scientists and AI developers only have a minimal
ability to explain why these models made a given decision over another one, and how their
capabilities arise from their known internal mathematical components. This contrasts, for example,
with complex software systems such as web search engines, where the developers can explain the
function of individual components (such as lines and files of code) and can also investigate why the
system found a particular result. Current ‘interpretability’ techniques for explaining the internal
structures of general-purpose AI models are unreliable and require major simplifying assumptions
(1009, 1010*, 1011*, 1012, 1013*). In practice, techniques for interpreting the inner workings of neural
networks can be misleading (466, 1014, 1015*, 1016, 1017, 1018, 1019), and can fail sanity checks or
prove unhelpful in downstream uses (1020, 1021, 1022, 1023, 1024, 1025*). For example, one goal of
interpretability research is to help researchers understand models well enough to edit their
behaviours by modifying their weights. However, state-of-the-art interpretability tools have not yet
proven useful and reliable for this (1026*). As discussed in 3.4.1. Training more trustworthy models,
these research methods are actively being improved, and new developments may yield further
insights. However, because of how deep learning models represent information across neurons in a
highly distributed way (1027, 1028), it is unclear whether interpreting the inner structures of
general-purpose AI models could offer guaranteed safety assurances. In other words, modern
general-purpose AI systems may be too complex to tractably make performance guarantees for. At
present, computer scientists are unable to give guarantees of the form ‘System X will not do Y’ (41).
Nonetheless, a deeper understanding of models’ inner workings could be useful in many ways (see
3.4.2. Monitoring and intervention and 3.4.1. Training more trustworthy models).
D. Harmful behaviours, including unintended goal-oriented behaviours, remain persistent: ensuring
that general-purpose AI systems act in accordance with the goals, behaviours and capabilities
intended by their developers and users is difficult. Although general-purpose AI systems can excel
at learning what they are ‘told’ to do, their behaviour may not necessarily be what their designers
intended (607, 1029, 1030, 1031). Even subtle differences between a designer's goals and the
objectives given to a system can lead to unexpected failures. For example, general-purpose AI
chatbots are often trained to produce text that will be rated positively by evaluators, but user
approval is an imperfect proxy for user benefit. As a result, several widely-used chatbots have
displayed ‘sycophantic’ or actively misleading behaviour, making statements that users approve of
regardless of whether they are true (98, 317, 522, 608). For example, general-purpose AI language
models are known to have a strong tendency to agree with opinions that a user expresses in chats
(98). Even when a general-purpose AI system receives correct feedback during training, it may still
develop a solution that does not generalise well when applied to new situations once deployed
(‘goal misgeneralisation’) (616, 1032, 1033). For example, some researchers have found that language
models’ safety training can be ineffective if the model is prompted in a language that was
underrepresented in its training data (1034). Since the publication of the Interim Report (May 2024),
researchers have demonstrated examples of unwanted goal-oriented behaviour from
general-purpose AI systems. These include attempts at rewriting their own goals (599*).
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.2 General challenges for risk management and policymaking
174
Despite efforts to diagnose and debug issues, developers have not always been able to prevent
even well-known and overtly harmful behaviours from general-purpose AI systems in foreseeable
circumstances. Empirically, state-of-the-art general-purpose AI systems have exhibited a variety
of harmful and often unexpected behaviours post-deployment (41, 1035, 1036). These hazards
include general-purpose AI systems assisting malicious users in overtly harmful tasks (127, 319,
1037, 1038, 1039, 1040, 1041); leaking private or copyrighted information (1042, 1043, 1044*, 1045,
1046, 1047); generating hateful content (1048, 1049); exhibiting social and political biases (183, 438,
491, 511, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564, 565); pandering to user biases (98); and hallucinating inaccurate
content (101, 102*, 104, 461, 1050, 1051*). Meanwhile, users have consistently been able to
circumvent state-of-the-art general-purpose AI model safeguards with relative ease through
prompting (‘jailbreaks’) (39, 155, 460, 904*, 1052, 1053, 1054, 1055, 1056*, 1057, 1058, 1059, 1060,
1061, 1062, 1063*) or simple model modifications (906, 1064, 1065, 1066, 1067, 1068, 1069, 1070, 1071,
1072, 1073, 1074, 1075, 1076, 1077, 1078, 1079, 1080). Since the publication of the Interim Report (May
2024), some researchers have also found that even when chat systems safely refuse harmful
requests, they can still behave harmfully when used to operate as agents (1000, 1001*).
Researchers continuously develop new techniques that defend against these attacks, but they also
develop stronger attacks that usually overcome the existing defences (see 3.4.1. Training more
trustworthy models).

General-purpose AI systems sometimes gain and retain harmful capabilities even when they are
explicitly fine-tuned not to (41, 1069). While current techniques are effective at suppressing harmful
behaviours from general-purpose AI systems, these harmful capabilities can and do resurface from
anomalies, inputs from malicious users, and modifications to models. For example, fine-tuning
GPT-3.5 on only ten examples of harmful text can undo its safeguards and make it possible to elicit
harmful behaviour (1064). The difficulty of making general-purpose AI systems fully resistant to
overt failure modes has led some researchers to question whether it is possible to make current
development approaches robust to such failure modes (1081, 1082). See 2.1. Risks from malicious
use for further discussion of harmful capabilities in AI models, 2.4. Impact of open-weight generalpurpose AI models on AI risks for a discussion of the benefits and risks of releasing models with
both harmful and beneficial capabilities for public download, and 3.4.1. Training more trustworthy
models for a discussion of methods for unlearning harmful capabilities.
E. An ‘evaluation gap’ for safety persists: current safety evaluations are not thorough enough to
meet existing governance frameworks and commitments from companies. Both developers and
regulators are increasingly proposing risk management frameworks that rely on high-quality
evaluations of general-purpose AI systems. The goal of evaluations is to identify risks so that they
can be addressed or monitored. However, the science of evaluating general-purpose AI systems
and predicting their downstream impacts is immature. Even when general-purpose AI systems are
evaluated pre-deployment, new failure modes are often quickly discovered post-deployment
(1055). For example, users found methods to subvert o1’s safety fine-tuning within days of its
release, and some researchers publicised work on a method to reliably jailbreak the model only
three weeks after the model’s release (1083). Evaluating AI systems for harmful behaviours and 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.2 General challenges for risk management and policymaking
175
downstream risks is a rapidly growing field. However, the large scope of potential risks (933), the
limitations of benchmarking techniques (178, 1084, 1085), a lack of full access to systems (1086),
and the difficulty of assessing downstream societal impacts (928*, 930*, 933) make high-quality
evaluations challenging. 3.3. Risk identification and assessment will delve further into methods for
risk evaluation and broader risk assessment approaches.
F. System flaws can have a rapid global impact: because general-purpose AI systems can be shared
rapidly and deployed in many sectors (like other software), a harmful system can rapidly have a
global and sometimes irreversible impact. A small number of both proprietary and freely available
open-weight general-purpose AI models currently reach many millions of users (see 2.3.3. Market
concentration risks and single points of failure). Both proprietary and open-weight models can
therefore have rapid and global impacts, although in different ways (911). A risk factor for
open-weight models is that there is no practical way to roll back access if it is later discovered that
a model has faults or capabilities that enable malicious use (902) (see 2.4. Impact of open-weight
general-purpose AI models on AI risks, 2.1. Risks from malicious use). However, a benefit of openly
releasing model weights and other model components such as code and training data is that it also
allows a much greater and more diverse number of practitioners to discover flaws, which can
improve understanding of risks and possible mitigations (911). Developers or others can then repair
faults and offer new and improved versions of the system. This cannot prevent deliberate malicious
use (902, 1075), which could be a concern if a system poses additional risk (‘marginal risk’)
compared to using alternatives (such as internet search). All of these factors are relevant to the
specific possibility of rapid, widespread, and irreversible impacts of general-purpose AI models.
However, even when model components are not made publicly accessible, the model’s capabilities
still reach a wide user base across many sectors. For example, within two months of launch, the fully
closed system ChatGPT had over 100 million users (1087). 
Technical approaches to risk management

3.2.2. Societal challenges for risk management and policymaking
KEY INFORMATION

Several economic, political, and other contextual factors make risk mitigation for many risks
associated with general-purpose AI difficult:

A. As general-purpose AI advances rapidly, risk assessment, risk mitigation, governance, and
enforcement efforts can struggle to keep pace. Policymakers face the challenge of creating
governance and/or regulatory environments that are sufficiently flexible, agile and
future-proof.
B. Developers of general-purpose AI face strong competitive pressure, which can incentivise
them to conduct less thorough risk mitigations. Markets characterised by high fixed costs,
low marginal costs, and network effects tend to create competitive pressures that
discourage safety investments. The market for general-purpose AI is such a market.
C. The rapid growth and consolidation in the AI industry raises concerns about certain AI
companies becoming particularly powerful because critical sectors in society are dependent
on their products. Such companies may become more inclined to take excessive risks or cut
corners on safety standards if they expect that it would be costly for governments to let the
company fail.
D. The inherent lack of both algorithmic transparency and institutional transparency in
general-purpose AI makes legal liability hard to determine, potentially hindering governance
and enforcement. The fact that general-purpose AI systems can act in ways that were not
explicitly programmed or intended by their developers or users raises questions about who
should be held liable for resulting harm.
Key Definitions

● Algorithmic transparency: The degree to which the factors informing general-purpose AI
output, e.g. recommendations or decisions, are knowable by various stakeholders. Such
factors might include the inner workings of the AI model, how it has been trained, what data
it is trained on, what features of the input affected its output, and what decisions it would
have made under different circumstances.
● Institutional transparency: The degree to which AI companies disclose technical or
organisational information to public or governmental scrutiny, including training data, model
architectures, emissions data, safety and security measures, or decision-making processes.
● Winner takes all: A concept in economics referring to cases in which a single company
captures a very large market share, even if consumers only slightly prefer its products or
services over those of competitors.
● Race to the bottom: A competitive scenario in which actors like companies or nation states
prioritise rapid AI development over safety.

A. As general-purpose AI markets advance rapidly, governance, regulatory or enforcement efforts
can struggle to keep pace. A recurring theme in the discourse on general-purpose AI risk is the
mismatch between the pace of technological innovation and the development of governance
structures (1088). While existing legal and governance frameworks apply to some uses of
general-purpose AI systems, and several jurisdictions (such as the European Union, China, the US,
and Canada) have initiated or completed efforts to establish relevant standards or to regulate AI
broadly and general-purpose AI specifically, areas of regulatory uncertainty persist, particularly
regarding novel AI capabilities. In a market that is as fast-moving as the general-purpose AI market
currently is, it is very difficult to fill such gaps reactively, because by the time a governance and/or
regulatory fix is implemented it might already be outdated. For instance, critics of social media
regulation often point to challenges in areas such as data privacy, suggesting that these issues
developed more quickly than policymakers could effectively address them (1089, 1090).
Policymakers face the challenge of creating flexible regulatory environments that are robust to
technological change over time.
The pace and unpredictability of advancements in general-purpose AI pose an ‘evidence dilemma’
for policymakers. Given the sometimes rapid and unexpected advancements, policymakers will
often have to weigh potential benefits and risks of imminent AI advancements without having a
large body of scientific evidence available. In doing so, they face a dilemma. On the one hand,
pre-emptive risk mitigation measures based on limited evidence might turn out to be ineffective or
unnecessary. On the other hand, waiting for stronger evidence of impending risk could leave
society unprepared or even make mitigation impossible, for instance if sudden leaps in AI
capabilities, and their associated risks, occur. Companies and governments are developing early
warning systems and risk management frameworks that may reduce this dilemma. Some of them
trigger specific mitigation measures when there is new evidence of risks, while others require
developers to provide evidence of safety before releasing a new model.
B. Developers of general-purpose AI face strong competitive pressure, which can incentivise them
to conduct less thorough risk mitigations. The one-time cost of developing a state-of-the-art
general-purpose AI model is very high, while the marginal costs of distributing such a model to
(additional) users are relatively low. For example, the estimated cost of training GPT-4 was $40
million (27), but once trained, the cost of running the model for a single query is believed to be just
a few cents, allowing it to serve many users at a relatively low marginal cost. In economic theory,

these conditions can lead to a ‘winner takes all’ dynamic in which field leaders can quickly capture a
large market, whereas second-place actors will be at a significant disadvantage. As such, if cutting
corners in (for example) testing and safety could allow one developer to take the lead in model
capability, then there is a strong incentive to cut those corners (1091). This dynamic is visible in
social media platforms, where a large initial user base attracted more people to join certain
platforms because that is where their friends were, making the leading platform more valuable to
new users and further expanding its network, while newer social networks often struggled to
achieve critical mass (1092). The ‘winner takes all’ dynamic raises concern about potential ‘race to
the bottom’ scenarios, where actors compete to develop general-purpose AI models as quickly as
possible while under-investing in measures to ensure that the models are safe and ethical (1093,
1094).
Markets characterised by high fixed costs, low marginal costs, and network effects tend to create
competitive pressures that discourage safety investments. Economic theory and empirical studies
have shown that, under conditions of high fixed costs, low marginal costs, and strong network
effects, firms in highly competitive markets tend to under-invest in safety measures (1095, 1096,
1097, 1098). For instance, in the early commercial aviation industry, airlines operating with thin profit
margins due to high fixed costs of aircraft acquisition and maintenance sometimes cut corners on
safety procedures to reduce costs and maintain competitive ticket prices (1099). These conditions
are present in the general-purpose AI market. Moreover, in highly competitive markets with
significant first-mover advantages, economic theory suggests that risk-taking behaviour tends to
be rewarded and may become prevalent among surviving firms (1100). While direct studies of
safety investment in the AI market are currently lacking, these economic principles and empirical
studies in other fields suggest cause for concern. This could contribute to situations in which it is
challenging for general-purpose AI developers to commit unilaterally to stringent safety standards,
as doing so might put them at a competitive disadvantage (1101). At the same time, from a
long-term business perspective, releasing risky models without adequate safety measures could
damage user trust and company reputation, potentially creating stronger incentives for safety
investment than the short-term competitive pressures might suggest.
C. The rapid growth and consolidation in the AI industry raises concerns about certain AI
companies becoming particularly powerful because critical sectors in society are dependent on
their products, which might incentivise them to take excessive risks (see 2.3.3. Market
concentration and single points of failure). Such scenarios are well studied in the economic
literature (1102). They arise when an organisation reaches a size and level of influence so substantial
that potential failure could pose systemic risks to the economy or national security. Governments
are therefore inclined to take steps to protect these organisations from failure, for example by
forgiving debts or providing bailout money. When protected in this way, companies may become
more inclined to take excessive risks or cut corners on safety standards (1103, 1104), though
empirical evidence on this effect remains mixed (1105). There is some concern that critical sectors
in society might over time become overly dependent on the products of a small number of leading
AI companies in this way. AI applications are becoming more integral to everyday life, and smaller 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.2 General challenges for risk management and policymaking
179
startups often seek acquisition by or collaboration with larger companies to overcome market
entry barriers, most notably the extremely high costs of training a general-purpose AI model. In
such arrangements, the startups typically trade access to their innovations for use of the larger
companies’ computing infrastructure and latest models, further reinforcing the market
concentration and, potentially, overreliance on the AI products of a few industry leaders (767).
Beyond market concentration dynamics, several other factors may contribute to underinvestment
in risk mitigation. Similar to environmental pollution or public health issues such as tobacco, many
potential harms from AI systems represent externalities – costs that may be borne by society
rather than directly by the developers (1106, 1107, 1108). Additionally, economic theory suggests that
when there is a significant time lag between actions and consequences, market actors may
systematically underinvest in risk mitigation (1109). This challenge is compounded by the inherent
uncertainty of these potential harms, making it difficult to quantify the appropriate level of
investment in risk mitigation. While empirical evidence on this question is scarce, economic theory
suggests that the immediate costs of risk mitigation weighed against uncertain future benefits
creates incentives for underinvestment in safety measures.
D. General-purpose AI systems’ inherent lack of transparency and limited institutional transparency
in organisations that develop AI makes legal liability hard to determine, potentially hindering
governance and enforcement. Tracking the development and use of AI systems is important for
establishing liability for potential harms, monitoring and seeking evidence for malicious use, and
noticing malfunctions (1002, 1110, 1111). In principle, people and corporate entities are held
accountable, not the technology, which is why developers maintain a ‘human in the loop’ policy for
many critical areas, where a human must oversee and sign off on otherwise-automated processes.
However, tracing harm back to the responsible individuals is very challenging (1112, 1113, 1114), as is
gathering evidence of error or negligence. This stems from both technical and institutional factors:
AI models' decision-making processes are difficult to interpret even for their developers (lack of
algorithmic transparency), and AI companies often treat their training data, methodologies, and
operational procedures as commercially sensitive information not open to public scrutiny (lack of
institutional transparency) (1025*, 1115, 1116, 1117, 1118, 1119, 1120). Without transparency into both
technical systems and organisational processes, it is difficult to develop the kinds of
comprehensive safety governance standards that are common in other safety-critical fields such
as automotive, pharmaceuticals, and energy (1121, 1122, 1123). The fact that general-purpose AI
systems can act in ways that were not explicitly programmed or intended by their developers or
users raises questions about who should be held liable for resulting harm (174, 1124). These liability
challenges become even more pronounced with increasingly autonomous AI systems that require
less direct human oversight, as it becomes harder to trace specific harmful actions back to human
instructions or decisions (see 3.1. Risk management overview).
The concentration of AI expertise in private companies can create significant information gaps for
policymakers and the public. While academic researchers and public sector experts contribute to
AI development and safety research, much of the cutting-edge work in AI development occurs
within private companies (1125, 1126). This concentration of expertise can make it challenging for 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.2 General challenges for risk management and policymaking
180
policymakers and the public to access the technical knowledge needed to make informed
decisions about AI governance and risk management. The resulting information asymmetry
between AI developers and other stakeholders could complicate efforts to develop appropriate
governance and/or regulatory frameworks and safety standards.

3.3. Risk identification and assessment
KEY INFORMATION

● Assessing general-purpose AI systems for hazards is an integral part of risk management.
Scientists use a variety of techniques to study hazards during system development, before
deployment, and after deployment.
● Existing AI regulations and commitments require rigorous risk identification and assessment.
Governments and general-purpose AI developers have adopted policies that require them to
identify and assess the potential risks and impacts of general-purpose AI systems on people,
organisations, and society.
● While very useful, existing quantitative methods to assess general-purpose AI risks have
significant limitations. Safety risks heavily depend on how and where these systems are used,
which is often unanticipated, making it hard to measure risks without guessing how people
will use them. This is especially challenging for general-purpose AI because it can be used in
countless different situations, and many potential harms (e.g. bias, toxicity, and
misinformation) are hard to measure objectively. While current risk assessment methods are
nascent, they can be greatly improved.
● Rigorous risk assessment requires combining multiple evaluation approaches, significant
resources, and better access. Key risk indicators include evaluations of systems themselves,
how people apply them, as well as forward-looking threat analysis. For evaluations at the
technical frontier to be effective, evaluators need substantial and growing technical ability
and expertise. They also need sufficient time and more direct access than is currently
available to the models, training data, methodologies used, and company-internal evaluations
– but companies developing general-purpose AI typically do not have strong incentives to
grant these.
● In recent months, more research has been evaluating how well AI risk assessment methods
actually work, identifying current shortcomings and criteria for improvement. While more
evidence is needed – especially for new risks – this technical progress is complemented by
institutional developments, as governments begin to build evaluation capacity and
stakeholders work to establish clearer guidelines for who is responsible for different aspects
of risk assessment.
● The absence of clear risk assessment standards and rigorous evaluations is creating an
urgent policy challenge, as AI models are being deployed faster than their risks can be
evaluated. Policymakers face two key challenges: 1. internal risk assessments by companies
are essential for safety but insufficient for proper oversight, and 2. complementary
third-party and regulatory audits require more resources, expertise and system access than
is currently available.

Key Definitions

● Risk: The combination of the probability and severity of a harm that arises from the
development, deployment, or use of AI.
● Hazard: Any event or activity that has the potential to cause harm, such as loss of life, injury,
social disruption, or environmental damage.
● Deployment: The process of implementing AI systems into real-world applications, products,
or services where they can serve requests and operate within a larger context.
● Evaluations: Systematic assessments of an AI system's performance, capabilities,
vulnerabilities or potential impacts. Evaluations can include benchmarking, red-teaming and
audits and can be conducted both before and after model deployment.
● Benchmark: A standardised, often quantitative test or metric used to evaluate and compare
the performance of AI systems on a fixed set of tasks designed to represent real-world
usage.
● Red-teaming: A systematic process in which dedicated individuals or teams search for
vulnerabilities, limitations, or potential for misuse through various methods. Often, the red
team searches for inputs that induce undesirable behaviour in a model or system to identify
safety gaps.
● Jailbreaking: Generating and submitting prompts designed to bypass guardrails and make an
AI system produce harmful content, such as instructions for building weapons.
● Audit: A formal review of an organisation’s compliance with standards, policies, and
procedures, typically carried out by an independent third party.
● Incident reporting: Documenting and sharing cases in which developing or deploying AI has
caused direct or indirect harms.
To manage the risks of general-purpose AI, it is necessary to understand and measure the risks it
poses to people, organisations, and society. Several governments and general-purpose AI
developers have already adopted policies and regulations that require them to identify and assess
the potential risks and impacts of general-purpose AI systems, triggering planned responses when
risks reach specific thresholds. ‘Risk identification’ is the process of identifying the potential risks of
the technology, including possible hazards and unintended outcomes. ‘Risk assessment’ is the
process of assessing the severity and likelihood of occurrence of each identified risk. (See Table 3.1
in 3.1 Risk Management Overview for an overview of risk management stages including risk
identification and assessment as well as risk evaluation, risk mitigation, and risk governance).
Methods for risk identification

General-purpose AI risks can be identified and formulated at various levels of specificity. For
example, one broad category of general-purpose AI risks is confabulating or ‘hallucinating’
misinformation – that is, generating outputs that are inaccurate or misleading. A more specific
instance of the same risk is general-purpose AI making up a non-existent polling location when the
user prompts it to gather information about where to cast their ballot during a national election 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.3 Risk identification and assessment
183
(1127). The specification of a risk can make it easier or more difficult for evaluators to assess both
its severity and likelihood. Better-specified risks are easier to assess and mitigate.
Evaluators need to understand the use cases of general-purpose AI well in order to conceptualise
its risks with the appropriate degree of specificity. For example, if general-purpose AI users are
likely to prompt it to gather information about political campaigns and voting procedures, then
assessing the risk of the model ‘hallucinating a polling location’ may be a high priority. Therefore
participatory approaches, which consist of engaging with various stakeholders and impacted
communities to understand their use cases, practices, needs, and values, are especially helpful for
identifying higher-priority risks to users. Crowd audits (1128) are one example of a participatory
approach. They are designed to allow everyday users to collaboratively surface the potential harms
of AI products and services. Creating accessible mechanisms for the public to report observed and
perceived harms is another important method of risk identification. AI incident-tracking databases,
such as the OECD’s AI Incidents Monitor (AIM), are platforms designed to collect, categorise, and
report harmful incidents involving AI (459). In short, there is a need to identify and assess risks in
context.
To facilitate general-purpose AI risk-identification practices, scholars have proposed taxonomies
of hazards (439, 933, 951*, 1129). These taxonomies list risk categories, such as informational
hazards, memorisation of the training data (which can lead to copyright infringement and privacy
concerns), and malicious usage (e.g. writing malware). Taxonomies of hazards can serve as a
starting point to help evaluators conceptualise, identify, and specify the salient risks associated
with general-purpose AI in specific application domains. In conventional risk management and
safety engineering, there are several well-established methods for identifying hazards and risks of a
technology, including functional failure analysis and HAZOP (hazard and operability study) (1130).
These methods have been adopted in a wide range of industries, including the automotive industry,
which also considers SOTIF (946). In addition to risk typologies and taxonomies, recent work has
begun adapting some of these conventional techniques, e.g. hazard analysis, the bowtie method
and safety cases, to AI products and services (968, 1131, 1132, 1133), but additional research is
necessary in this area. See 3.1. Risk management overview for a discussion of further risk
identification practices established in other fields.
Methods for risk assessment
Once high-priority risks are identified, they need to be assessed to determine the likelihood and
severity of the harm, hazard, or unintended outcome in question.
Better understanding the current state of general-purpose AI risk assessment methods is essential
to AI policy because risk assessments are a core component of many AI governance and regulatory
approaches. For example, the EU AI Act classifies AI systems into four main risk tiers based on their
potential impact and imposes different requirements on AI systems depending on their risk tier.
Furthermore, many leading AI companies have agreed to create AI safety commitments with 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.3 Risk identification and assessment
184
mitigations that are proportional and specific to the assessed risk of their systems (1134). However,
risk assessment is a relatively nascent topic of research in the AI safety community, and there are
currently no fully validated, systematic approaches to assessing the severity and likelihood of
general-purpose AI harms. Implementing the aforementioned policies will require a substantially
more mature field of risk assessment for general-purpose AI.
Existing work in AI safety heavily focuses on conventional model testing approaches in AI, often
conducted after the development of general-purpose AI models. This reliance on retrospective (as
opposed to prospective) risk assessment can lead to major omissions and misestimations of
high-priority risks. In conventional risk management and safety engineering, a critical stage of risk
assessment is the prospective analysis of risks before completing the design and development of a
system. This stage is currently often overlooked in general-purpose AI risk assessments. In AI
safety, risk assessment primarily consists of running a battery of tests and evaluations on the
general-purpose AI system, then translating the results into quantitative estimates of risks. This is
in contrast to traditional risk assessment, which consists of 1. analysing the causes, consequences,
and prevalence of risks (through methods such as causal mapping and Delphi technique) then
2. evaluating whether the risk is acceptable, e.g. through checklists and risk matrices. Recent work
has begun adapting some of these techniques to AI products and services (944, 968). See 3.1. Risk
management overview for further discussion of risk assessment approaches that are established in
other fields.
Existing technical approaches and methodologies to general-purpose AI risk assessment rely
heavily on testing and evaluations which can be broken down into four layers (1135):

1. Model testing evaluates the general-purpose AI model in terms of (often quantitative)
metrics of performance on proxy tasks designed to represent real-world usage. These tests
often take the form of benchmarks – fixed sets of prompts to test a model on.
2. Red-teaming is a systematic process in which dedicated individuals or teams search for
vulnerabilities, limitations, or potential for misuse in AI models or systems through various
methods. Often, the red team searches for inputs that induce undesirable behaviour for the
purpose of improving the model or system’s protections against such attacks.
3. Field testing evaluates the risks of general-purpose AI under real-world conditions.
4. Long-term impact assessments monitor and evaluate long-term impacts of the system on
people, organisations, and society.
One major evidence gap is research to establish the validity, reliability, and practicality of
existing general-purpose AI risk assessment methods. Good risk measurement methods must
be valid, reliable, and practical. Validity refers to the extent to which a test, tool, or instrument
accurately measures what it is intended to measure. For instance, validity issues arise if a
benchmark differs from real-world use or contains false labels (1136). Reliability refers to the
consistency, stability, and dependability of a measurement over time and across different
contexts. In other words, it indicates the degree to which a measurement yields consistent, 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.3 Risk identification and assessment
185
repeatable results under similar conditions (1137). Prior work has shown that even small
perturbations to prompts can have significant effects on the behaviour and performance of
general-purpose AI on benchmarks (1138, 1139). Practicality assesses whether the
measurement can be conducted efficiently and effectively in practice by the designated
evaluators, considering constraints such as time, cost, computational resource availability,
and burden on evaluators. For example, the process of evaluating general-purpose AI
increasingly relies on using general-purpose AI (522, 929*), which requires technical capacity
and raises new concerns (e.g. about LLM agents favouring outputs from their own model
family (1140). For rigorous risk assessment, validity and reliability are prioritised over ease and
convenience of measurement (1141).
Since the publication of the Interim Report, the scientific community has made progress
toward further implementing and evaluating existing risk assessment methods. The US and UK
AI Safety Institutes (US AISI and UK AISI) recently published a technical report detailing a
pre-deployment evaluation of the upgraded version of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (1142). New research
has examined reproducibility (1143, 1144*) or validity, which can be compromised when AI
models are trained on or exposed to test data beforehand (benchmark contamination) (1145,
1146). However, additional evidence is necessary to characterise the strengths and
weaknesses of existing general-purpose AI evaluation methods (465) especially when
general-purpose AI is utilised in new domains.
The initial layer of general-purpose AI risk assessment often consists of testing the model's
behaviour across certain fixed benchmarked tasks. New benchmarks and standardised tests and
metrics have been designed to evaluate and compare various categories of risk for
general-purpose AI applications in stylised scenarios and tasks (122, 137, 141, 1147*, 1148, 1149*). For
example, the AI Safety Benchmark from MLCommons (457) provides a benchmark to measure
seven risk categories, such as misinformation and harmful content. Holistic Evaluation of Language
Models (HELM) consists of 16 scenarios and seven metrics, including robustness, fairness, and bias
(1150). Harmful capability evaluations (318*) are used to assess whether the general-purpose AI has
particularly dangerous knowledge or skills (such as the ability to aid cyberattacks (2.1.3. Cyber
offence) or aid the design of bioweapons (2.1.4. Biological and chemical attacks)). Highly
consequential upcoming decisions by companies and governments about model release partially
rely on these evaluations (596*, 947*, 1134). Existing benchmarks significantly vary in quality (1151),
and the scope of applicability for existing benchmarks is often unclear. Some best practices for
creating high-quality benchmarks have been proposed (1151, 1152*).
While model testing methods can serve as a necessary first step toward assessing the risks of
general-purpose AI, they are not sufficient on their own. It is impossible to derive reliable
quantitative conclusions about the risks these methods aim to capture without making strong
assumptions about patterns of use in specific applications. Such assumptions are hard to justify:
First, the technology is general-purpose and can be used in numerous contexts, so it is difficult to
predict patterns of use. Second, some risks (e.g. bias, toxicity, and misinformation) are difficult to 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.3 Risk identification and assessment
186
specify objectively, and any definitions must rest on questionable assumptions about what is (for
example) ‘toxic’ or ‘biased’. Therefore, benchmarks cannot capture the risks associated with the
usage of general-purpose AI in new domains and for novel tasks, because test conditions always
differ from real-world usage to varying degrees (1153*). Benchmarks at best serve as a proxy
measure for the risk category in question (for example, subjective ratings of human annotators or
content moderators may serve as proxy for ‘toxicity’ (1154)). However, these proxy measures often
do not reliably reflect the true risk in context. For instance, if human evaluators are not diverse, this
can lead to benchmarks containing biased labels, since people from similar backgrounds might
systematically miss certain examples of toxicity or misinformation. Moreover, improving scores on a
benchmark does not always translate to lowering the associated risk in practice. For example, an
LLM can pass the bar exam for lawyers, but that does not mean that it can create effective legal
briefs (445, 446, 451). Any fixed benchmark is often easy to improve on without mitigating the
target risk (1070). While creating capacity for dynamically evolving, collaborative benchmarks may
address some of these challenges, it is important for AI evaluators to understand the inherent
limitations of quantitative approaches to model testing (1155) and avoid over-reliance on them as
the primary layer of risk assessment.
Red-teaming and adversarial attacks are other prominent methods to identify and assess risks, but
can require special access. ‘Red team’ refers to a set of evaluators tasked with finding
vulnerabilities in a system by attacking it. In contrast to benchmarks, which are mostly static and
consist of a fixed set of test cases, a key advantage of red-teaming is that it adapts the evaluation
to the specific system being tested. Through adversarial interactions with a system, red-teamers
can design custom inputs to identify worst-case behaviours, malicious use opportunities, and
unexpected failures. As an example, attacks against language models can take the form of
automatically generated inputs (904*, 1053, 1063*, 1156, 1157, 1158*, 1159, 1160, 1161, 1162) or manually
generated ones (1056*, 1059, 1158*, 1163). In automated attacks, for example, LLMs can be used to
generate prompts designed to make another AI system produce harmful content, such as
instructions for dangerous materials, even after the system initially refuses. These ‘jailbreaking’
attacks subvert the models’ safety restrictions (460, 904*, 1052, 1053, 1164, 1165*). Automated
approaches can systematically test thousands of variations of potential attacks, allowing for more
extensive and rapid coverage than manual testing alone. However, manual red-teaming over longer
conversations can catch issues that current automated attacks alone can miss (1056*). However, it
can be slow, labour intensive, and require special access. Further research for faster and effective
automated red-teaming is necessary to address this challenge (1166).
While red-teaming is more effective at surfacing a wider range of general-purpose AI risks than
model testing, many important harms and hazards may remain undetected. Importantly, if a
red-teaming activity fails to surface certain categories of risks, that does not imply that those risks
are unlikely. Previous work has found that bugs often evade detection (1022). A real-world example
is jailbreaks, which induce general-purpose chat systems to comply with harmful requests that
they were trained to refuse (460, 904*, 1052, 1053, 1164), and which evaded initial detection by
developers (48*, 147*, 1158*). Research has also called into question whether red-teaming can 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.3 Risk identification and assessment
187
produce reliable and reproducible results. One study shows that red-teaming practices in industry
diverge along several key axes, including the setting (e.g. the characteristics of red-teamers and the
resources and methods available to them), and the decisions it informs (e.g. subsequent reporting,
disclosure, and mitigation) (1167). The composition of the red team and the instructions provided to
red-teamers (1168*), the number of attack rounds (1056*), and the availability of auxiliary or
automation tools (1161, 1169) can significantly influence the outcomes of the activity, including the
risk surface covered. See Table 3.2 for an overview of criteria for structuring red-teaming activities
in practice. Comprehensive guidelines on red-teaming aim to address some of these challenges
(1170).

‘Field tests’ are exercises designed to assess risks under normal use conditions. ‘Human uplift
studies’ examine whether people can use AI to perform malicious tasks better than they could
without AI. ‘Human uplift’ studies are one important variant of field testing. They aim to measure
how access to general-purpose AI systems improves individuals’ competencies and performance.
For example, a human uplift study might explore how an AI system affects a person’s ability to
accomplish complex tasks, such as customer support (662) or (potentially harmful) cybersecurity
operations (361, 1171, 1172, 1173), compared to their performance without the AI assistance. These
studies aim to quantify the ‘uplift’ in human capabilities and assess whether the AI’s support
introduces new risks, such as lowering barriers to harmful conduct (see 2.4. Impact of open-weight
general-purpose AI models on AI risks for further discussion of uplift studies). However, there are
several challenges in designing and conducting such studies, including simulating conditions similar 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.3 Risk identification and assessment
188
to ordinary use and choosing the appropriate measures of uplift. Evaluators could address some of
these challenges if there were better guidelines for conducting human uplift studies and integrating
them into the staged rollout of general-purpose AI products. In other safety-critical industries, for
example drug testing in clinical trials, a series of studies are conducted in increasingly more realistic
conditions (for example, going from testing on animals to human-subject studies), before the drug
is deemed ready to market. A similar approach may prove useful for developing effective field
testing methods for general-purpose AI.
Certain risks associated with general-purpose AI are likely to manifest only in the long run, making
long-term impact assessments crucial. Such risks include the effects of the technology on labour
markets and the future of work (2.3.1. Labour market risks), risks associated with more capable
future AI systems (2.2.3. Loss of control, 2.1.3. Cyber offence, 2.1.4. Biological and chemical attacks),
the environmental impact of AI development and use (see 2.3.4. Risks to the environment), and
long-term impacts on human cognition, wellbeing, and control (1003). Careful monitoring,
investigating and rectifying long-term harms is necessary to maintain the public's confidence in the
technology and prevent calls for unnecessarily strong controls. Accurately gauging the downstream
societal impacts of general-purpose AI is challenging due to 1. uncertainties surrounding the
capabilities of future general-purpose AI systems, and 2. the existence of numerous confounding
factors that make it difficult to attribute long-term trends to any single cause. Creating capacity for
predicting and monitoring the potential downstream societal impacts of general-purpose AI
requires multidisciplinary analysis and the involvement of diverse perspectives (929*, 1174, 1175).
Challenges and opportunities
In addition to the challenges discussed here, see also 3.2.1. Technical challenges for risk
management and policymaking and 3.2.2. Societal challenges for risk management and
policymaking.
The culture of ‘build-then-test’ in AI hinders comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation.
In conventional risk management, risk assessment is integrated into all stages of product design,
development, and deployment, and is tightly intertwined with risk mitigation strategies. In AI safety,
however, current risk assessment methods are largely conducted after development, and
independent from risk mitigation. Prior work (978) has proposed the creation of safety case studies
and safety guarantees for AI (1176). Adapting and implementing such practices for general-purpose
AI requires both a cultural shift and further research.
The four layers of risk assessment (model testing, red-teaming, field testing, and long-term impact
assessment) are necessary but not sufficient for comprehensive risk assessment. Existing methods
do not provide generalisable guarantees or assurances surrounding the likelihood and severity of
general-purpose AI harms (1177). The main evidence gaps are in 1. assessing the validity, reliability
and practicality of each evaluation layer independently, and 2. combining information from different
layers of evaluation to produce actionable insights (41). 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.3 Risk identification and assessment
189
Conducting comprehensive risk assessment, in practice, requires considerable access, resources,
and time, which are often constrained. Very few entities have the resources (or the will to allocate
the necessary resources) to conduct comprehensive evaluations, and potential conflicts of interest
can lead to misleading results and reports (1014, 1178). Moreover, sometimes evaluators are not
given enough time to thoroughly test models. In some cases, companies only provided evaluators
with several days to test a new model before release (2*, 129). Effective model evaluation requires
substantial time and resources.
Furthermore, developers of state-of-the-art general-purpose AI systems often limit external
access to their technology (880). For models that are hosted on a developer’s platform or that
have to be accessed via an API (giving ‘black box’ access, only to model inputs and outputs), it can
be challenging for external evaluators to perform effective adversarial attacks, model
interpretations, and fine-tuning (1086, 1179). For example, AI models are usually trained to refuse
dangerous requests, but to assess dangerous capabilities, evaluators require access to versions of
the model without this guardrail. This access is sometimes provided (2*). Without it, certain
high-priority risks may be overlooked. Incomplete information about how a system was designed,
including data, techniques, implementation details, and organisational details hinders evaluations of
the development process (34, 488, 1086, 1180, 1181, 1182). Some scholars have argued that a
combination of technical, physical, and legal measures can offer external researchers’ direct access
without compromising trade secrets more than they are already compromised (1086). Several
studies have advocated for legal ‘safe harbours’ (1036) or government-mediated access regimes
(939) to enable evaluators to conduct independent evaluations without the risk of being
prosecuted or banned from use. Researchers have proposed methods for structured access that
do not require making the model’s code and training weights public (1183), but that do make it
possible for independent researchers and auditors to fully access the model in a secured
environment designed to avoid leaks. Researchers are developing auditing techniques that use
‘secure enclaves’. These techniques have the potential to avoid leaking the model parameters to
auditors, and also the audit details to model developers (1184).
Successful risk assessment requires the participation of diverse perspectives in the evaluation
process. The composition of the evaluation team in evaluation layers, such as red-teaming, can play
a critical role in the process of discovering, characterising, and prioritising harms (1185). Improving
stakeholder participation has been a focus of the machine learning community in recent years (932,
1186, 1187). Multiple strategies have been proposed, from broadening the understanding of ‘impacts’
in AI impact assessments (1188) to enabling a more inclusive range of human feedback (1189, 1190).
However, fostering participation requires sensitivity to several criteria (1186), such as respect for
participating parties to minimise the potential for exploitation (540), and surfacing hard choices
between incompatible values or priorities (467, 538, 574). This process can be facilitated by
methods from practical ethics such as ‘reflective equilibrium’ – the mutual adjustment of principles
and judgements until they agree with each other (1191).
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.3 Risk identification and assessment
190
Policymakers face several challenges around how to incentivise adequate risk identification
and assessments for general-purpose AI systems. Without clear guidelines, standards, and
resources surrounding general-purpose AI risk assessment, practitioners face uncertainties as
to what constitutes adequate risk assessments in their specific use cases. This in turn makes
it difficult for policymakers to incentivise compliance. Another policy challenge is how to
designate responsibility for various layers of risk assessments across different
general-purpose AI stakeholder groups, including technology creators, users, and third-party
auditors (763). Another approach is creating resources (for example, ‘sandboxes’ and ‘safe
harbours’) that promote public-interest evaluations (1036) or third-party audits. The success
of this approach hinges heavily on the availability of resources, trained evaluators and experts,
incentives to conduct rigorous evaluations (for example, by offering indemnity and
compensation), and access to models or information about data and methods used. Several
governments have begun to build capacity for conducting technical evaluations and audits of
general-purpose AI. It remains to be seen how much these efforts will advance
interdisciplinarity and inclusive evaluation of general-purpose AI in the near future, and how
much they can and will be scaled in practice (537, 540, 1192, 1193).

3.4. Risk mitigation and monitoring
3.4.1. Training more trustworthy models
KEY INFORMATION

● Current training methods show progress on mitigating safety hazards from malfunctions
and malicious use but remain fundamentally limited. There has been progress in training
general-purpose AI models to function more safely, but no current method can reliably
prevent even overtly unsafe actions.
● A multi-pronged approach is emerging as necessary for safety. Evaluating the
trustworthiness of models requires analysing many aspects of their behaviour and their
development process – including factual accuracy, human supervision quality, AI system
internals, and analysis of potential misuse patterns – all of which must inform training
methodologies. While techniques exist to remove harmful capabilities, current methods
tend to suppress rather than eliminate them.
● Adversarial training provides limited robustness against attacks. Adversarial training
involves deliberately exposing AI models to examples designed to make them fail or
misbehave during training, aiming to build resistance to such cases. However, adversaries
can still find new ways ('attacks') to circumvent these safeguards with low to moderate
effort, such as 'jailbreaks' that lead models to comply with harmful requests even if they
were fine-tuned not to do so.
● Since the publication of the Interim Report (May 2024), recent advances reveal both
progress and new concerns. Improved understanding of model internals has advanced
both adversarial attacks and defences without a clear winner. Additionally, growing
evidence suggests that current training methods – which rely heavily on imperfect human
feedback – inadvertently cause models to mislead humans on difficult questions by
making errors harder to spot. Improving the quantity and quality of human feedback is an
avenue for progress, though nascent training techniques using AI to detect misleading
behaviour also show promise.
● Key challenges for policymakers centre around uncertainty and verification. There are no
reliable methods to quantify the risk of unexpected model failures. While some
researchers are exploring provably safe approaches, these remain theoretical. This
suggests that frameworks for safety training currently need to focus on processes to
search for, respond to, and mitigate new failures before they cause unacceptable harm.

Key Definitions

● Interpretability: The degree to which humans can understand the inner workings of an AI
model, including why it generated a particular output or decision. A model is highly
interpretable if its mathematical processes can be translated into concepts that allow
humans to trace the specific factors and logic that influenced the model's output.
● Red-teaming: A systematic process in which dedicated individuals or teams search for
vulnerabilities, limitations, or potential for misuse through various methods. Often, the red
team searches for inputs that induce undesirable behaviour in a model or system to identify
safety gaps.
● Adversarial training: A machine learning technique used to make models more reliable. First,
developers construct ‘adversarial inputs’ (e.g. through red-teaming) that are designed to
make a model fail, and second, they train the model to recognise and handle these kinds of
inputs.
● Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF): A machine learning technique in which
an AI model is refined by using human-provided evaluations or preferences as a reward
signal, allowing the system to learn and adjust its behaviour to better align with human
values and intentions through iterative training.
● Jailbreaking: Generating and submitting prompts designed to bypass guardrails and make an
AI system produce harmful content, such as instructions for building weapons.
The risks of general-purpose AI systems may be mitigated in part by limiting their behaviours. For
example, policymakers may wish to prevent general-purpose AI systems from providing dangerous
information to users (e.g. on the production of weapons; see 2.1.4. Biological and chemical attacks),
being used for malicious purposes (e.g. for cyberattacks; see 2.1.3. Cyber offence), or having
malfunctions that lead to harm (see 2.2. Risks from malfunctions). A system’s behaviour is safe if it
avoids such mistakes, and a system is robust if it continues to behave safely in a wide range of
circumstances. Beyond this, a system is adversarially robust if it maintains safe behaviour even in
the presence of an adversary (e.g. a human user) trying to get it to perform harmful or illegal tasks.
There exist proposals for how to build general-purpose AI systems which are guaranteed to behave
safely (1176), but this is not possible without significant technological advances and may require
significant changes to the architecture of current general-purpose AI systems. Regulation of
current systems will have to focus on ensuring that their training and development minimises the
harms of malfunctions and misuse.
Since the publication of the Interim Report, both attackers and defenders have become
better at leveraging a deeper understanding of AI systems’ internal workings to respectively
induce or prevent harmful behaviour, and the advantage remains with attackers. New
methods to resist adversarial attack by leveraging the concepts internally represented in
neural networks have been developed both for image models (1194*) and language models
(1195). However, these approaches are not completely robust, and another recent study has
shown that language models internally represent the refusal of harmful requests in a simple 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.4 Risk mitigation and monitoring
193
way which allows them to be easily exploited as well (907). On balance, the advantage
generally remains with attackers, who can induce a model to engage in harmful behaviour with
only moderate effort. However, these developments suggest that further research on both
attacks and defences will likely leverage progress in interpretability. If this is true, further
advances may favour defenders in the case of closed-weights models, since attackers will not
have access to neural network internals in these cases.
Evidence has also grown that existing methods for training general-purpose models can lead
them to produce more misleading (i.e. false but convincing) outputs. A recent study showed
that in the case of especially challenging questions, training general-purpose AI systems to
maximise human approval of the answers led the systems to obfuscate their mistakes and
make them harder for humans to spot, instead of becoming more accurate (608). Other
studies in simulated environments have found that an AI learns to use harmful strategies (e.g.
hiding information or exploiting its supervisor’s biases) to receive positive feedback (1196) or
modify its training environment to increase its reward (599*), if enough information is
available to the AI on how to do so. Using AI to help supervisors avoid errors remains a
challenging problem, but there has also been modest progress in this area, with two recent
studies showing cases where models become easier to supervise when optimised to debate
themselves (1197, 1198). These developments highlight the need for further research
investigating the behaviours incentivised by current training methods, and developing new
training methods that provide better incentives and generally more trustworthy outputs by
design.
The main evidence gaps around training trustworthy models include:

● Despite recent progress (1010*, 1012, 1199)), it is still unclear whether interpretability
methods, which help researchers and evaluators understand how models function
internally, will be useful enough to substantially inform model training and testing. There
are preliminary studies of this (1076, 1200, 1201).
● It is unclear whether ‘scalable oversight’ protocols, where AI systems can help humans
evaluate their outputs, can provide a strong lever by which models can be trained to be
more trustworthy even on hard problems (609*).
● There are currently no viable technical approaches to rigorously quantifying the risk of
unforeseen or unexpected failures in large general-purpose AI systems. Although there is
ongoing research on obtaining probabilistic safety guarantees, there is no practical
technique to obtain even approximate guarantees yet.
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.4 Risk mitigation and monitoring
194
For policymakers, key challenges include:

• Research moves very quickly in AI training, making it a moving target for regulation.
• It is difficult to quantify the risk of unexpected, unforeseen failure modes. In addition, it is
unclear what are the best practices by which AI developers should detect, respond to, and
mitigate newly discovered failures to minimise risks.
Robustness
Incentivising safe and correct behaviour during system training
It is challenging to precisely specify objectives for general-purpose AI systems in a way that does
not unintentionally incentivise harmful behaviours. Currently, researchers do not know how to
specify abstract human preferences and values (such as reporting the truth, figuring out and doing
what a user wants, or avoiding harmful actions) in a way that can be used to train general-purpose
AI systems. Moreover, given the complex socio-technical relationships embedded in
general-purpose AI systems, it is not clear whether such specification is even possible. After an
initial pre-training phase, general-purpose AI systems have learned to imitate human behaviour and
are then generally tuned to optimise for objectives that are imperfect proxies for the developer’s
true goals (1031). For example, AI chatbots are often tuned to produce text that will be rated
positively by human evaluators, but user approval is an imperfect proxy for user benefit. Research
has shown that several widely used chatbots sometimes match their stated views to a user’s views
regardless of truth (98, 522) possibly creating ‘echo chambers’, and that training general-purpose
AI systems to satisfy human evaluators’ assessments can incentivise the system to provide
harder-to-check answers that obfuscate the system's mistakes (608). This is an ongoing challenge
for general-purpose AI systems (607, 1029, 1031, 1202*).
Researchers have methods to measure whether training incentivises the right behaviour using
experiments with human evaluators, but current results are preliminary. ‘Scalable oversight’
experiments test whether an evaluator can successfully steer an AI system to correctly perform a
task that the evaluator is unable to demonstrate or evaluate themselves – for example, to answer
questions (such as hard science questions) which require specialised expertise to check (609*,
1203*). This provides a strong empirical check that the training protocol being used incentivises the
right behaviour. Protocols under development for scalable oversight often enlist the AI system itself
in helping the evaluator, for example by having it engage in a debate with itself over the correct
answer (611*), and letting a human evaluator steer the model on the basis of that debate. Recent
human and AI debate experiments show that this can improve the ability of human evaluators to
determine the right answers to hard questions (615*, 1198, 1204*), and preliminary results show that
this can translate into an improved training incentive (1197). However, positive results have only
been shown on a simple reading comprehension task, with mixed results for other tasks such as
mathematics problems (1198). These methods have not been used to train general-purpose AI 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.4 Risk mitigation and monitoring
195
systems, but progress in this area is continuing, and scalable oversight experiments may at some
point form a practical way of measuring how reliably training techniques incentivise the correct
behaviour.
Some researchers are working toward ‘safe-by-design’ approaches which might be able to provide
quantitative safety guarantees. Beyond ensuring that an AI’s training process encodes the incentive
to be safe, it may be possible to design AI systems that quantitatively guarantee certain levels of
safety (1176). These proposals often rely on a combination of three elements: first, a specification of
desired and undesired outcomes (which in some cases could be a natural language description of
desired and unacceptable behaviours), second, a ‘world model’ that includes capturing
(approximate) cause and effect relationships and predicts the outcomes of possible actions the AI
system could take, and third, a verifier that checks whether a given candidate action would lead to
undesirable predicted outcomes. The goal of this process is to guarantee that dangerous actions
are not taken. If the world model captures scientific knowledge, it will typically rely on
‘neuro-symbolic’ hybrids of general-purpose AI and classic techniques using formal mathematics.
The advantage of mathematical guarantees and bounds is that they may provide safety assurances
even outside of the domain in which the AI has been trained and tested, in contrast with spot
checks and improvement through trial-and-error which are currently the standard for evaluating
and training general-purpose AI models. This explicit model-based approach offers two additional
advantages: firstly, because it uses formal logic and probability laws to analyse clearly defined
knowledge components, its conclusions are more trustworthy, understandable, and verifiable than
those of traditional AI systems. Secondly, it allows building non-agentic (non-autonomous) AI
systems that can advance science and human knowledge while remaining easy to control, avoiding
the potential risks that come with advanced highly agentic AI (see 2.2.3. Loss of control). Currently,
however, practically useful, provable guarantees of safety have yet to be demonstrated for
general-purpose AI models and methods, and many open questions remain in order to achieve
those objectives for large-scale AI systems (1205).
Maintaining the quality of human supervision and evaluation of AI behaviour

State-of-the-art training and evaluation techniques rely on feedback or demonstrations from
humans and, as such, are constrained by human error and bias. Developers fine-tune
state-of-the-art general-purpose AI systems using a large amount of human involvement. In
practice, this involves techniques that leverage human-generated examples of desired actions (28)
or human-generated feedback on examples from models (29, 30, 31*, 1182). This is done at scale,
making it labour-intensive and expensive. However, human attention, comprehension, and
trustworthiness are not perfect (1182), which limits the quality of the resulting general-purpose AI
systems (1206, 1207*, 1208). Even slight imperfections in feedback from humans can be amplified
when used to train highly capable systems, with potentially serious consequences (see for example
2.2.3. Loss of control).
 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.4 Risk mitigation and monitoring
196
Improving the quality and quantity of human oversight can help to train more robust models. Some
research has shown that using richer, more detailed forms of feedback from humans can provide
better oversight for AI models, but at the cost of increased time and effort for data collection
(1209*, 1210, 1211). To gather larger datasets, leveraging general-purpose AI systems to partially
automate the feedback process can greatly increase the volume of data (33*, 256*). However, in
practice, the amount of explicit human oversight used during fine-tuning is very small compared to
the trillions of data points used in pre-training on internet data, and so human oversight may,
therefore, be unable to fully remove harmful knowledge or capabilities from pre-training. Improving
fine-tuning feedback data is likely to form only a part of the solution to cooperative robustness.
Improving the factuality of model outputs

The hallucination of falsehoods is a challenge, but it can be reduced. In AI, ‘hallucination’ refers to
the propensity of general-purpose AI systems to output falsehoods and made-up content. For
example, language models commonly hallucinate non-existent citations, biographies, and facts (101,
102*, 103, 104, 105), which could pose legal and ethical problems involving the spread of
misinformation (1212). It is possible but challenging to reduce general-purpose AI systems'
tendency to hallucinate untrue outputs. Fine-tuning general-purpose AI models explicitly to make
them more truthful – both in the accuracy of their answers and analysis of their own competence –
is one approach to tackling this challenge (1213*). Additionally, allowing language models to access
knowledge databases when they are asked to perform tasks helps to improve the reliability of their
generations (838, 1214). Alternative approaches detect hallucinations and inform the user if the
generated output is not to be trusted (1215), perform fine-grained checks on the individual claims
made by a model (1216), or quantify the model’s confidence (1217). However, reducing hallucination
remains a very active area of research.
Improving robustness against unexpected failures

Ensuring that general-purpose AI systems learn beneficial behaviours that translate from their
training contexts to real-world, high-stakes deployment contexts is highly challenging. Sometimes,
unfamiliar inputs that a general-purpose AI system encounters in deployment can cause
unexpected failures (1218). Just as general-purpose AI systems are trained to optimise for
imperfect proxy goals, the training context can also fail to adequately represent the real-world
situations that systems will encounter after they are deployed. In such cases, general-purpose AI
systems may still take harmful actions even if they are trained with correct human-provided
feedback (616, 1032, 1033). For example, some researchers have found that chatbots are more likely
to take harmful actions in languages that are underrepresented in their training data (1034). One
way to mitigate these failures is with evaluation frameworks that test many combinations of
deployment conditions, such as the Holistic Evaluation of Language Models framework (HELM
(1150)), which enumerates and tests combinations of many different tasks, user profiles, and
languages, among other features. Another is to develop methods by which models can estimate
and communicate their uncertainty in rare cases to anticipate mistakes (1219*, 1220*). However, in 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.4 Risk mitigation and monitoring
197
general it is likely impossible to enumerate all possible real-world situations for evaluation or to
anticipate all potential mistakes.
Understanding a model’s internal computations might help researchers to investigate whether they
have learned robust solutions. Methods exist to automatically identify features (i.e. mathematical
patterns) inside a neural network model which correspond to human-interpretable concepts (1009,
1013*, 1221, 1222*), including specific people and places as well as abstract concepts and behaviours
such as errors in code, nonconformity to certain political opinions, or descriptions of how to create
drugs (1012). These features can serve as a guide to identifying dangerous or undesirable
behaviours in a system’s training data or its outputs at a larger scale than would be practical with
human review alone. Researchers have attempted to automate this review using an ‘automated
interpretability agent’ that has access to interpretability tools. A preliminary study shows that this
is possible on a small scale (1201), and there is no clear barrier to scaling up this kind of work.
There is recent progress on using understanding of a model’s internal workings to improve its
behaviour, but this approach needs more work. Despite the difficulty of understanding models’
inner workings, some techniques can be used to guide specific edits to them. Compared to
fine-tuning, these methods can sometimes be more compute- or data-efficient ways of modifying
models’ functionality. Researchers have used a variety of methods for this, based on making
changes to models’ internal parameters learned during training (1223, 1224, 1225, 1226, 1227),
neurons (1221, 1228, 1229), or representations (1199, 1230, 1231, 1232, 1233). These techniques are
imperfect (1023), generally limited to very specific kinds of behaviours (1227), and typically
introduce unintended side effects on model behaviour (1234), but they remain an active area of
research. It is unclear to what extent current methods offer a ‘useful and reliable’ way of
understanding and engineering general-purpose AI models (1026*).
Adversarial robustness: preventing model misuse

Users of general-purpose AI systems can often bypass their safeguards with ‘jailbreaks’ that induce
them to comply with harmful requests. Even if a system always behaves well under normal use, a
motivated individual may still construct unusual inputs that are specifically designed to make a
system fail or engage in undesired (e.g. harmful) behaviours (1054). Language models in particular
are subject to general purpose ‘jailbreaks’ which can make them much more likely to comply with
harmful requests. Examples of jailbreaking methods include: inducing an AI system to adopt the
persona of someone who would say the harmful content (1053), priming it with examples of harmful
answers (1235*), or making requests in a language that was scarce in the system’s training data
(1236), which could increase models’ vulnerability in some low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs) (see Table 3.3 for some example jailbreaks). While jailbreaks can be partially guarded
against after their discovery, it is difficult to anticipate them during model development, and
currently, it is generally easy to find new jailbreaks that work for state-of-the-art models. This
being the case, it is unclear how widely jailbreaks are used to actually cause harmful behaviour by
AI systems outside of a research setting.

release, and new jailbreaks continue to be found for state-of-the-art systems.

Training models to detect and refuse harmful requests from adversaries

Adversarial training helps improve robustness in state-of-the-art AI systems, though only to a
limited extent. ‘Adversarial training’ involves first constructing ‘attacks’ designed to make a model
act undesirably, and second, training the system to handle these attacks appropriately. Attacks
against AI systems can take many forms and can be either human- or algorithm-generated. Once
an adversarial attack has been produced, training on these examples can proceed as usual.
Adversarial training has become a commonly used technique to make models more robust to
failures, and is used in the development of major general-purpose AI systems (4*, 48*, 147*, 1158*,
1163, 1241). However, it is not sufficient by itself, as adversarially trained systems are still generally
vulnerable to attack, especially with multimodal inputs (e.g. with images). Moreover, the potential
appropriateness or harmfulness from an AI system’s outputs cannot always be evaluated outside of
the context in which it is used, which is not available during adversarial training (1242).
Making general-purpose AI systems more robust to unforeseen attacks is a challenging open
problem, but there are potentially promising methods for minimising the relevant harms.
Adversarial training generally requires specific examples of failures (598*, 1243). These limitations
have resulted in ongoing games of ‘cat and mouse’ in which some developers continually update
models in response to newly discovered vulnerabilities. The process of searching for vulnerabilities
and attempting to induce undesirable behaviour is known as ‘red-teaming’. A partial solution to
models’ continued vulnerability is to simply produce and train on more adversarial examples.
Automated methods for generating attacks can help scale up adversarial training (522, 904*, 1157,
1244). However, the exponentially large number of possible inputs for general-purpose AI systems
makes it intractable to thoroughly search for all types of attacks. Interpretability methods might
help here (907), and there has been preliminary progress on improving robustness through
methods that operate on the model’s internal states (1076, 1195, 1200). Even if all attacks cannot be
prevented beforehand, if they can be detected quickly at run-time then systems can be efficiently
adapted to defend against them: in one study, a system had greater than 95% success defending
against attacks after seeing only one example of the same kind of attack (1245). While research on
these mitigations is preliminary, requiring live monitoring, response, and adversarial training
mitigations on potentially dangerous AI systems is critical for decreasing the damage of AI misuse.
‘Machine unlearning’ methods aim to remove certain undesirable capabilities from general-purpose
AI systems, but current techniques often suppress rather than fully remove such capabilities. For
example, machine unlearning can remove certain capabilities that could aid malicious users in
making explosives, bioweapons, chemical weapons, and cyberattacks (392). Unlearning as a way of
negating the influence of undesirable training data was originally proposed as a way to protect
privacy and copyright (821), discussed in 2.3.6. Risks of copyright infringement. Unlearning methods
to remove hazardous capabilities (892, 1246) include methods based on fine-tuning (893*) and
editing the inner workings of models (392). Ideally, unlearning should make a model unable to
exhibit the unwanted behaviour even when subject to knowledge-extraction attacks, novel
situations (e.g. requests in various languages), or small amounts of fine-tuning. However, current 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.4 Risk mitigation and monitoring
200
unlearning methods often suppress harmful information without removing it robustly (1247). This
creates challenges for governance, since models might appear to lack harmful capabilities when
these are actually just hidden and can be reactivated. Current unlearning methods may also
introduce unwanted side effects on desirable model knowledge (1247). It is unclear if unlearning a
harmful skill could fully remove the model’s ability to perform a harmful task by combining desirable
skills and knowledge. Unlearning remains an area of active research.

3.4.2. Monitoring and intervention
KEY INFORMATION

● Monitoring and intervention are complementary approaches for preventing AI system
malfunctions and malicious use. Monitors inspect system inputs and outputs, hardware
state, model internals, and real-world impacts while systems are used, triggering
interventions that block potentially harmful actions. Current tools can detect AI-generated
content, track system behaviour, and identify concerning patterns across these
monitoring targets. However, moderately skilled users can often circumvent these
safeguards through various technical means.
● Model interpretability and explanation methods can help monitor AI decisions but current
methods can also produce misleading insights. Technical approaches for explaining AI
system outputs help developers and deployers scrutinise decision-making, though studies
indicate that these methods can produce inaccurate or oversimplified explanations of
complex model behaviour.
● Multiple layers of monitoring and intervention create stronger protection against
malfunctions and malicious use. Combining technical monitoring and intervention
capabilities with humans in the loop builds stronger safeguards, though these measures
can introduce costs and delays.
● In recent months, there has been progress in model interpretability and hardware-based
monitoring measures. Since the publication of the Interim Report (May 2024), model
interpretability research has progressed to begin explaining model behaviours, and early
work investigating privacy-preserving hardware-based monitoring has the potential to
improve regulatory visibility into AI development.
● Key challenges for policy makers centre on balancing safety measures against their
practical costs. While layered safety measures provide stronger protection, they also
introduce operational delays, raise privacy concerns, and increase deployment costs.
Policymakers therefore need to weigh safety requirements against these practical
constraints, particularly given potential misalignment between safety measures and
business incentives.

Key Definitions

● Model: A computer program, often based on machine learning, designed to process inputs
and generate outputs. AI models can perform tasks such as prediction, classification,
decision-making, or generation, forming the core of AI applications.
● System: An integrated setup that combines one or more AI models with other components,
such as user interfaces or content filters, to produce an application that users can interact
with.

● Interpretability: The degree to which humans can understand the inner workings of an AI
model, including why it generated a particular output or decision. A model is highly
interpretable if its mathematical processes can be translated into concepts that allow
humans to trace the specific factors and logic that influenced the model's output.
● AI-generated fake content: Audio, text, or visual content, produced by generative AI, that
depicts people or events in a way that differs from reality in a malicious or deceptive way,
e.g. showing people doing things they did not do, saying things they did not say, changing
the location of real events, or depicting events that did not happen.
● Deepfake: A type of AI-generated fake content, consisting of audio or visual content, that
misrepresents real people as doing or saying something that they did not actually do or say.
● Digital forensics: The process of tracing the origin and spread of digital media.
● Watermark: A subtle, often imperceptible pattern embedded within AI-generated content
(such as text, images, or audio) to indicate its artificial origin, verify its source, or detect
potential misuse.
● Defence in depth: A strategy that includes layering multiple risk mitigation measures in
cases where no single existing method can provide safety.
● Human in the loop: A requirement that humans must oversee and sign off on otherwise
automated processes in critical areas.
● AI agent: A general-purpose AI which can make plans to achieve goals, adaptively perform
tasks involving multiple steps and uncertain outcomes along the way, and interact with its
environment – for example by creating files, taking actions on the web, or delegating tasks
to other agents – with little to no human oversight.
Monitoring and intervention strategies are applied to AI systems – the complete deployment
package that includes both the AI model and additional safety components – leaving the model
unchanged. Unlike the strategies discussed in 3.4.1. Training more trustworthy models, monitoring
and intervention methods are integrated at the system level and implemented as part of system
deployment. This section discusses monitoring and intervention strategies that researchers and
developers use for general-purpose AI systems (see Figure 3.2).
The main evidence gaps around monitoring and intervention include understanding how
effective methods are, and how easy they are to circumvent. Monitoring and intervention
techniques are, in many cases, easy, simple, and effective system-level safeguards in typical
use cases. They offer an essential additional line of defence aside from the model-level
techniques discussed in 3.4.1. Training more trustworthy models. From this perspective, there
are few technical barriers to the widespread adoption of many techniques. However,
scientists do not yet have a thorough quantitative understanding of their effectiveness in
real-world settings and how easily monitoring methods can be coordinated across the AI
supply chain. A key barrier toward highly effective monitoring and intervention techniques is
understanding how vulnerable they are to being actively circumvented by malicious users.

Detecting AI-generated content

Content generated by general-purpose AI systems – particularly ‘deepfakes’ – could have
widespread harmful effects (1248, 1249, 1250) (see 2.1.1. Harm to individuals through fake content).
However, the ability to distinguish between genuine and AI-generated content can help to reduce
the harmful use of generative models. For example, if web browsers were able to put reliability
notices on content that was likely AI-generated, this would help to combat the spread of
misinformation online. There are a variety of technical tools for the detection of AI-generated
content. None are perfect, but together, they can be immensely helpful for digital forensics.

Unreliable but still useful techniques exist for detecting AI-generated content. Just as different
humans have discernible artistic and writing styles, so do generative AI models. Some procedures
have been developed to distinguish AI-generated text (332, 333, 337, 338, 1251, 1252, 1253) and
images (1254, 1255) from human-generated content. Detection methods are typically based either
on specialised classifiers or assessing how likely it is that a given example was generated by some
general-purpose AI model. However, existing methods are limited and are prone to mistakes. A
significant challenge is that general-purpose AI systems tend to memorise examples that appear in
their training data. Because of this, common text snippets (e.g. famous historical documents) or
images of common objects (e.g. famous art) are sometimes falsely classified as being AI-generated.
As general-purpose AI-generated content becomes more realistic, it may be increasingly
challenging to detect. Meanwhile, AI-text detectors tend to have inconsistent performance across
world languages, posing challenges to linguistic equality (1256).
‘Watermarks’ – subtle but distinct motifs inserted into AI-generated data – make distinguishing
AI-generated content easier, but they can be removed. Watermarks are features that are often
designed to be difficult for a human to notice but easy for detection algorithms to identify.
Watermarks typically take the form of imperceptible patterns inserted into image or video pixels
(290, 291, 292, 293, 294*, 1257), imperceptible signals in audio (295, 296), or stylistic or
word-choice biases in text (297, 1258, 1259, 1260, 1261). Watermarks can be used to detect
AI-generated content with near perfect accuracy when they are not tampered with. As discussed
in 2.1.1. Harm to individuals through fake content, they can be used to detect AI-generated fake
content. They are an imperfect strategy for detecting AI-generated content (especially text)
because they can be removed by simple modifications to data (298*, 299, 333, 1262). However, this
does not mean that they are not useful. As an analogy, fingerprints are easy to avoid or remove, but
they are still very useful in forensic science. Finally, there are concerns about privacy and potential
misuse of watermarking technology, as it could be used to track and identify users (300).
Watermarks can also be used to indicate genuine, non-AI-generated content. Certifying the
authenticity of data is part of ‘data provenance’. In contrast to inserting watermarks into
general-purpose AI-generated content, another approach is to automatically insert watermarks
into non-AI-generated content (1263). However, this will often require changes to the hardware and
software of physical recording devices. These provenance methods would be very hard to tamper
with at the device level. Some researchers are working towards common methods and standards
for tracing the origin of media, including the use of encryption methods to prove authenticity which
are difficult to counterfeit (e.g. CPPA (1264); AIMASC (1265)).
‘Metadata’ and system activity logs aid in digital forensics. ‘Digital forensics’ refers to the science of
identifying and analysing digital evidence (1266, 1267, 1268, 1269, 1270). It is common for data to be
saved along with ‘metadata’ that gives additional context about the data that is stored. This
metadata is useful (and commonly used) for tracing the origin of data. For example, many mobile
devices save image and audio files using the Exchangeable Image File Format (ExIF) standard (1271)
which can store information about camera settings, time, location, and other details. Similar 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.4 Risk mitigation and monitoring
205
metadata could be used to help track information about whether data was generated by a
general-purpose AI system and, if so, other details about how it was done. For example, developers
and deployers could attach identifiers to actions taken by an AI system (1272, 1273). Developers
and deployers can also save ‘activity logs’ to track system behaviour, in order to improve
monitoring over time (1272). Additionally, simply adding warning labels to AI-generated content can
help to reduce the spread of misinformation. One study found that these labels improved humans’
deepfake detection from 10.7% to 21.6% (289). Metadata can typically be tampered with, but
evidence suggests that the use of encrypted digital signatures can enable proof of authenticity in a
way that is very hard to counterfeit (1274).
Beyond technical interventions, digital media literacy initiatives have also been proposed to
combat AI-generated fake content (1275). Some studies have found that media literacy
interventions can improve participants' ability to detect fake content (1276, 1277, 1278, 1279).
However, in general, evidence on the effects of digital media literacy interventions is mixed, partly
due to large variations in study contexts and intervention designs (1279). See 2.1.1. Harm to
individuals through fake content for further discussion of fake content.
Detecting and defending against harmful content

Although there is no perfect safety measure, having multiple layers of protection and redundant
safeguards increases confidence in safety (a strategy known as ‘defence in depth’). While the
present section focuses on technical approaches, systems are not deployed in a vacuum.
Embedding them in a sociotechnical system that seeks to maintain safety and performance is key
to the ongoing process of identifying, studying, and defending against harm (also discussed in 3.1.
Risk management overview). This section discusses various complementary technical methods of
detecting and defending against harmful behaviours from general-purpose AI systems.
Detecting anomalies and potentially harmful behaviours allows for precautions to be taken. Some
methods have been developed that can help detect anomalous inputs or behaviours from AI
systems (1280, 1281, 1282). For example, users sometimes trick language models into behaving
harmfully by having them encode their responses in ciphered text (460, 1063*) that does not at all
resemble normal text. It is also sometimes possible to detect a significant proportion of inputs
(1243, 1283), internal states (1284, 1285, 1286*, 1287), or outputs (1287, 1288, 1289, 1290*, 1291)
involved in harmful behaviours such as assisting with dangerous tasks. Once detected, risky
examples can be sent to a fault-handling process or flagged for further investigation. For example,
data flagged as harmful could be blocked by a filter or edited to remove harmful content.
Having a human in the loop allows for direct oversight and manual overrides but can be
prohibitively costly. Humans in the loop are expensive compared to automated systems. However,
when there is a high risk of a general-purpose AI system taking unacceptable actions, a human in
the loop can be essential. Analogously, manual overrides are standard in cars that have
autonomous driving modes (1292). Meanwhile, humans and general-purpose AI systems can 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.4 Risk mitigation and monitoring
206
sometimes make decisions collaboratively. Instead of teaching general-purpose AI systems to act
on behalf of a human, the human-AI cooperation paradigm aims to combine the skills and strengths
of both general-purpose AI systems and humans (1293, 1294*, 1295, 1296, 1297, 1298, 1299).
However, having a human in the loop is not practical in many situations, such as times when
decision-making happens too quickly (such as chat applications with millions of users), or the
human does not have sufficient domain knowledge, or human bias and error can exacerbate risks
(1300). Humans in the loop of automated decision-making also tend to exhibit ‘automation bias’,
meaning that they place a greater amount of trust in the AI system than intended (1301). In cases
where a human in the loop is not practical, hybrid approaches involving a mix of human and
automated monitoring and intervention are possible.
Secure operation protocols can be designed for general-purpose AI systems with potentially
dangerous capabilities. General-purpose AI agents which can act autonomously and without
limitation on the web or in the physical world pose elevated risks (see 3.2.1. Technical challenges for
risk management and policymaking and 2.2.3. Loss of control). For general-purpose AI systems with
potentially risky capabilities, limiting the ways in which they can directly influence the world makes
it easier to oversee and manage them (1302, 1303). For example, if an agentic general-purpose AI
system has an unconstrained ability to access a computer’s file systems and/or run custom code, it
is safer to run that agent in an ad hoc computing environment than directly on the user’s computer
(22*). However, these approaches can be hard to implement for applications in which a system
must act directly in the world. In these cases, it is sometimes difficult even for humans to anticipate
when an action might be harmful.
Explaining AI system actions

Some techniques can be used to help explain why deployed general-purpose AI systems act the
way they do. Understanding why general-purpose AI systems act the way they do is useful for
evaluating capabilities, diagnosing harms, and determining accountability if harm is caused (1304,
1305, 1306). While it can be useful, simply asking general-purpose AI language models for
explanations of their decisions can also lead to misleading answers (97, 1307). To increase the
reliability of model explanations, researchers are working on improved prompting and training
strategies (1308*, 1309*, 1310, 1311). Meanwhile, other techniques for explaining general-purpose AI
model actions (1312, 1313) can sometimes help with finding problems in models (1163). However,
correctly explaining general-purpose AI model actions is a difficult problem because of their size
and complexity. Some research is working toward developing techniques for helping humans
interpret the computations of general-purpose AI systems (1010*, 1011*, 1012). Techniques to help
explain model decisions are recognised as a useful part of the model evaluation toolbox (1314).
However, these methods provide only a partial understanding. They depend on significant
assumptions and more research is needed to demonstrate how useful they are in practice.

 3.4 Risk mitigation and monitoring
207
Monitoring and interventions with specialised hardware

Privacy-preserving monitoring mechanisms integrated into computing hardware are emerging as a
more reliable and trustworthy alternative to software-based monitoring or self-reporting. Compute
is central to the development and deployment of modern general-purpose AI systems, and the
amount of compute used for training and inference is correlated with the capability of an AI system
(see 1.3. Capabilities in coming years). Research into privacy-preserving hardware mechanisms
aims to enable policymakers to monitor and verify certain aspects of general-purpose AI systems
during training and deployment, such as compute usage, without relying on reporting by AI
developers. For example, research into these mechanisms argues that they make it technically
feasible to verify usage details such as time and location of usage (1315, 1316), the types of models
and processes being run (1317, 1318), or to provide proofs that a particular model was trained (1319,
1320). If feasible, these mechanisms can be applied to many governance issues, such as verifying
adherence to international agreements even across borders (270). Some countries consider
international agreements because of the competitive pressures between countries and its effect
on incentives to thoroughly manage risks (see 3.2.2. Societal challenges for risk management and
policy making for an analysis of this dynamic). In this context, countries may resist monitoring and
verification of agreements due to concerns about intellectual property and competitive
advantages. Hardware-based verification mechanisms are sometimes considered to address this
shortcoming since they could enable monitoring of key metrics while preserving the confidentiality
of proprietary AI systems and training data. However, these applications are still in the stage of
early research (270).
While much of the required functionality for hardware-based mechanisms exists on today's AI
chips, hardware-based monitoring has not yet been proven at scale and could threaten user
interests if implemented haphazardly. Some hardware-based mechanisms are widely deployed in
contexts outside of AI, such as Apple’s Secure Enclaves, which permit the manufacturer to restrict
which applications are installed on their devices (1321*). Some leading AI chips, such as the H100
graphics processing unit (GPU), already have some of the necessary hardware in the form of
Confidential Computing (1322*). Nonetheless, some hardware-based monitoring and verification
mechanisms for AI could themselves be compromised by a well-resourced attacker, potentially
leaking sensitive information (1323).

3.4.3. Technical methods for privacy
KEY INFORMATION

● General-purpose AI systems affect privacy through loss of data confidentiality, lack of
transparency, unauthorised processing of data, and novel forms of abuse. These risks are
described in 2.3.5. Risks to privacy.
● Multiple methods exist across the AI lifecycle to safeguard privacy. These include:
removing sensitive information from training data; model training approaches that control
how much information is learned from data (such as ‘differential privacy’ approaches); and
techniques for using AI with sensitive data that make it hard to recover the data (such as
‘confidential computing’ and other privacy-enhancing technologies). Many
privacy-enhancing methods from other research fields are not yet applicable to
general-purpose AI systems due to the computational requirements of AI systems.
● Since the publication of the Interim Report (May 2024), privacy protection methods have
expanded to address AI's growing use in sensitive domains. This includes smartphone
assistants, AI agents, always-listening voice assistants, or use in healthcare or legal
practice. There is a growing interest in ensuring confidentiality and consent across these
uses, with new research and practical implementations supporting this. Removing
personally identifiable information (PII) and undesirable content from the training data of
general-purpose AI, although still challenging and incomplete, is a cost-effective, feasible,
and effective process to reduce risk. User-friendly mechanisms for controlling and tracing
personal data could support this.
● Privacy protection methods for AI are evolving rapidly, creating policy challenges. Methods
to reduce privacy risks in general-purpose AI are complex and continue to develop at a
fast pace, affecting multiple areas of the supply chain and creating a challenging
environment for policymaking.
Key Definitions

● Privacy: A person's or group's right to control how others access or process their sensitive
information and activities.
● Personally identifiable information (PII): Any data that can directly or indirectly identify an
individual (for example, names or ID numbers). Includes information that can be used alone
or combined with other data to uniquely identify a person.
● Sensitive data: Information that, if disclosed or mishandled, could result in harm,
embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual or organisation.
● Data minimisation: The practice of collecting and retaining only the data that is directly
necessary for a specific purpose, and deleting it once that purpose is fulfilled.
● AI agent: A general-purpose AI which can make plans to achieve goals, adaptively perform
tasks involving multiple steps and uncertain outcomes along the way, and interact with its

environment – for example by creating files, taking actions on the web, or delegating tasks
to other agents – with little to no human oversight.
● Deepfake: A type of AI-generated fake content, consisting of audio or visual content, that
misrepresents real people as doing or saying something that they did not actually do or say.
Methods and techniques for mitigating privacy risks from general-purpose AI cover different risk
categories. 2.3.5. Risks to privacy broadly categorised risks into: Training Risks (risks from training
on data, especially sensitive data); Use Risks (risks from general-purpose AI handling sensitive
information during use); and Intentional Harm Risks (risks from malicious actors applying
general-purpose AI to harm individual privacy). This section considers mitigation techniques for
each of these categories, outlining emerging privacy-enhancing techniques (1324) for relevant
categories. Other related privacy harms can occur from malicious actors using general-purpose AI
for stalking, non-consensual deepfakes, or stealing sensitive information (2.1 Risks from malicious
use), which are difficult but possible to mitigate as outlined in 3.4. Risk mitigation and monitoring
and 2.1.3. Cyber offence.
Minimising personally identifiable information in training data is important and feasible, but
challenging (Reducing Training Risks). General-purpose AI is trained on large datasets collected
from many sources, including the public web. This data can include PII (1325, 1326), which can be
reproduced during the usage of AI models (827, 828, 1327, 1328). Companies can also use their
proprietary data to train models (1329*). Open datasets being used to train general-purpose AI
often attempt to remove PII (878, 1325) (although not all do (1330)) but can miss some PII. Without
clearer standards for the composition and possible PII inclusion of datasets (883, 1331), complete
cleaning of training data for general-purpose AI at scale will be challenging, but data cleaning
remains a cost-effective, feasible, and effective process in the meantime to reduce privacy risks.
Implementing user-friendly mechanisms for individuals to control and trace their data, such as
dashboards for managing permissions and secure data provenance systems, could enhance
transparency and accountability in general-purpose AI systems (Reducing Training Risks). This
could allow individuals to track how their data is used and shared, establish transparent processes
for individuals to access, view, correct, and delete their data, as well as to track how and where
others are profiting from their data (1332, 1333). This is possible for data held by the user and, to a
lesser extent, for data contained on digital service providers (such as social media platforms) who
can provide opt-out options for data usage or training (although users are often unaware of their
contributions to AI training or the risks of privacy violations) (847, 1334, 1335). If data is already
publicly available on the public web, it is and will remain much more complicated to control how
this data is used for general-purpose AI.
Privacy-preserving approaches to training on sensitive data are limited for general-purpose AI
(Reducing Training Risks). Various privacy techniques can be applied to AI models to protect
individual privacy while still allowing for useful insights to be derived from data (1336, 1337).
However, these techniques can significantly impair model accuracy (often referred to as a 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.4 Risk mitigation and monitoring
210
‘privacy-utility trade-off’), present challenges when applied to large models, and may not be
suitable for all use cases, in particular for general-purpose AI models trained on text (1328). For
domains with highly sensitive data (e.g. medical or financial), it may be possible to attain strong
privacy guarantees by adapting powerful general-purpose AI models that are first pre-trained on
publicly available data from the internet (1338*, 1339, 1340), but such techniques have rarely been
applied in practice so far. Another solution is using synthetic data (data, such as text or images,
that has been artificially generated, often by other AI systems) to avoid using sensitive data in
training pipelines (1341*, 1342). However, researchers have demonstrated that there is an important
privacy-utility trade-off and strong differential privacy is still required for privacy (1343, 1344, 1345,
1346). Differential privacy works by adding carefully calibrated noise to the training process, limiting
how much the model can learn about any individual's data while still allowing it to learn useful
patterns from the dataset as a whole. If the synthetic data is highly useful, it may carry as much
information as the original data and mostly enable the same attacks (1347, 1348, 1349).
Medium-capability general-purpose AI is increasingly able to run entirely on consumer devices
such as smartphones, enabling people to use general-purpose AI without sending personal data to
external servers (Reducing Use Risks). While the most capable general-purpose AI systems will
continue to be constrained to data centres due to their size (156*), smaller AI systems that can
answer questions about personal data and perform basic phone operations on behalf of a user are
increasingly being rolled out to consumer devices such as smartphones and other edge devices
(4*, 37*, 841*). Running general-purpose AI on-device means that user requests, and any personal
data that the AI accesses to respond to the user, do not need to be sent to an external cloud
server, reducing the risks of data leaks. However, for complex tasks, the use of general-purpose AI is
still often outsourced to (run on) cloud servers, requiring personal data and requests to be sent to
the cloud (via the internet).
Secure deployment of general-purpose AI systems in the cloud is important when handling
sensitive data (Reducing Use Risks). Many large general-purpose AI models can only be run in data
centres, which means that using sensitive data with these models requires sending that data to
external locations. Securing these deployments is a critical task for general-purpose AI (844), and
can help prevent private information from leaking. Recent large-scale deployments have built
end-to-end security solutions to address this issue, but more research is required to secure these
deployments (844).
Strong cryptographic approaches to running AI confidentially and securely end-to-end exist but
are not yet applicable to general-purpose AI (Reducing Use Risks). Research has shown that small
AI models can be run in combination with cryptographic tools such as homomorphic encryption
(1350), zero-knowledge proofs (1351), multi-party computation (1352, 1353), and hardware
protections (such as confidential computing on NVIDIA H100 GPUs) (1354, 1355, 1356*) to enable
both confidentiality of inputs and verifiability of secure computation. However, these techniques
impose significant costs (the various methods can differ in their costs by orders of magnitude) and
have not been scaled to the largest and most capable models being trained today. ‘Confidential 
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.4 Risk mitigation and monitoring
211
computing’ with H100 GPUs stands out as the only current cryptographic approach that is usable
with large models, but it is not a complete solution to end-to-end encryption or confidentiality.
Future advances in related fields may enable these strong security techniques to become practical
for general-purpose AI in the future (1177, 1357).
Practices such as data minimisation, purpose limitation, and other data protection will continue to
be important with general-purpose AI, and existing privacy regulations will continue to play a role in
determining the appropriate use of personal data (Reducing Training and Use Risks). Many
jurisdictions where general-purpose AI will be used have existing regulations that limit or place
guidelines on how personal data can be used (822, 1358). In many cases, the principles underlying
these regulations already apply to the ways in which general-purpose AI interacts with and uses
personal or sensitive data.
Malicious actors may be able to use general-purpose AI to violate the privacy of others through
general-purpose AI-enhanced stalking (Reducing Intentional Harm Risks). The content above
primarily discussed the risks to privacy from using sensitive or private data during the training or
usage of general-purpose AI systems. There is also a separate risk to privacy from malicious actors
using general-purpose AI to enhance existing privacy-violating practices. General-purpose AI can
infer the personal attributes of individuals at a lower cost, higher speed, and larger scale than
humans can (483*, 846, 1047). This could enable, for example, a malicious actor to search through
large data breaches and public information to infer attributes of individuals, infer information about
public content (such as where an image was taken), and perform automated actions to aid in the
exploitation of privacy, such as automatic personalised phishing or general-purpose AI-enabled
targeted stalking. Some legal frameworks aim to hold creators and distributors accountable for
malicious use (1359) and to provide remedies for individuals whose privacy has been violated.
Other general-purpose AI capabilities, such as advanced cybersecurity attacks to extract private
information or non-consensual deepfakes, may also worsen this trend. These outcomes could be
partly prevented through improved technical mitigations and are akin to the problems outlined
elsewhere in 3.4 Risk mitigation and monitoring and 2.1 Risks from malicious use.
General-purpose AI systems can also improve privacy by supporting cybersecurity practices in
development and explaining risks to users. While general-purpose AI creates many privacy risks, it
can also help mitigate them. General-purpose AI can be used in software development platforms
and tooling, which can support developers in designing secure software and scanning codebases
for possible security flaws (1047) (see 2.1.3. Cyber offence for more on using general-purpose AI
systems to fix software vulnerabilities). For users, understanding privacy risks and monitoring
personal exposure is challenging. Storytelling and user-centred explanations of risks and personal
online safety strategies are important (1360), and could be communicated with the aid of
general-purpose AI systems. AI systems could also be used to aid in tracking where personal data
is being used and communicate these findings to users.
Technical approaches to risk management
 3.4 Risk mitigation and monitoring
212
Since the publication of the Interim Report (May 2024), increased effort has been put into
improving the quality of data used to train general-purpose AI, enhancing the hardware
security of AI systems’ deployment, and making it possible to run and store models locally on
personal devices. As general-purpose AI becomes increasingly accessible on personal devices
such as assistants on smartphones (841*) and in sensitive contexts such as healthcare (1361*),
the strong security tooling for hosting general-purpose AI with verifiable privacy guarantees is
becoming more common (1362). This improved security in deployment (both on-device and in
the cloud) is complemented by work in filtering PII from web-scale pre-training data (878).
Recent general-purpose AI systems’ ability to autonomously act and plan on users' behalf (as
AI agents) has prompted new privacy risks (673, 1363).
Other downstream privacy considerations are also important. For example, a number of experts
have warned that if AI agents become indistinguishable from authentic humans on the web,
combating these systems would lead to risks of mass identification (and subsequent
surveillance) of online users (316*, 853). Privacy-preserving credentials to identify authentic,
unique personhood online could minimise these unintended effects on privacy (853).
Evidence gaps: more research is needed to study how and when general-purpose AI risks
revealing sensitive information, how general-purpose AI can be run with stronger security
guarantees, and how to prevent general-purpose AI from being used for privacy-exploiting
use cases. The full extent of personal data in general-purpose AI training data (1325) and the
likelihood of it being memorised and exposed (831, 1364) are unknown and require more
research. Even when sensitive data is used only at run time (often referred to as ‘in-context
learning’), more research is needed to establish the risks of models leaking information in their
output (847, 1365). When using these general-purpose AI systems, strong cryptographic
approaches to running them could enable more confidentiality and verifiability (1366), but
more work is needed to scale these techniques to large AI systems. To prevent harm from
malicious actors using general-purpose AI to violate the privacy of others, more research will
be needed into how to make it more difficult to use general-purpose AI for malicious
purposes. Many open technical questions exist about how to maintain the privacy of data
creators, users, and AI system deployers while leveraging and governing general-purpose AI
(1177). New risks to privacy may also emerge as new general-purpose AI capabilities emerge
(see 1.3. Capabilities in coming years).

For policymakers working on privacy, key challenges arise from a technical environment
where methods to address privacy risks and minimise harm are rapidly evolving, across
multiple areas of the general-purpose AI supply chain. The areas of risk discussed in this
section and in 2.3.5. Risks to privacy cover a broad spectrum of participants in the
general-purpose AI ecosystem, and mitigation strategies vary in their technical feasibility and
complexity (summarised in Figure 3.3). Each mitigation strategy will impose costs on
general-purpose AI developers and deployers (e.g. cleaning web-scale data is expensive) and
may worsen the user experience (e.g. strong cryptographic guarantees can slow down run

speeds of general-purpose AI). This area of research is evolving, and the extent to which
specific privacy risks will have robust mitigation strategies that can be deployed at scale will
be hard to predict, made further challenging by the differences between the AI and the
privacy policy communities (822).

Conclusion

The first International AI Safety Report finds that the future of general-purpose AI is remarkably
uncertain. There is a wide range of possible outcomes even in the near future, including both very
positive and very negative ones, as well as anything in between. General-purpose AI has immense
potential for education, medical applications, research advances in fields such as chemistry,
biology, or physics, and generally increased prosperity thanks to AI-enabled innovation. If managed
properly, general-purpose AI systems could substantially improve the lives of people worldwide.
To reap the benefits of this transformative technology safely, researchers and policymakers need
to identify the risks that come with it and take informed action to mitigate them. General-purpose
AI is already causing harm today due to malicious use and malfunctioning, for instance through
deepfakes, scams and biased outputs. Depending on the rate of progress of future general-purpose
AI capabilities, the technical methods that developers and regulators employ to mitigate risks, the
decisions of governments and societies in relation to general-purpose AI, and the degree of
successful global coordination, it is also possible that further risks could emerge. The worst
outcomes could see the emergence of risks such as large-scale unemployment, general-purpose
AI-enabled terrorism, or humanity losing control over general-purpose AI systems. Experts differ in
how likely or imminent they consider such risks and in how they interpret the existing evidence:
some think that such risks are decades away, while others think that general-purpose AI could lead
to severe public safety dangers within the next few years.
There exist technical methods for addressing the risks of general-purpose AI, but they all have
limitations. For example, researchers have developed methods for reducing bias, improving our
understanding of AI’s inner workings, assessing capabilities and risks, and making AI less likely to
respond to user requests that could cause harm. However, several features of general-purpose AI
make addressing risks difficult. Despite rapid advances in capabilities, researchers currently cannot
generate human-understandable accounts of how general-purpose AI arrives at outputs and
decisions. This makes it difficult to evaluate or predict what general-purpose AI is capable of and
how reliable it is, or to obtain assurances on the risks that it might pose. There is broad expert
agreement that it should be a priority to improve our understanding of how general-purpose AI
arrives at outputs and decisions.
AI does not happen to us; choices made by people determine its future. How general-purpose AI is
developed and by whom, which problems it is designed to solve, whether we will be able to reap its
full economic potential, who benefits from it, and the types of risks we expose ourselves to – the
answers to these and many other questions depend on the choices that societies and governments
make today and in the future to shape the development of general-purpose AI. Since the impact of
general-purpose AI on many aspects of our lives is likely to be profound, and since progress might
continue to be rapid, there is an urgent need to work towards international agreement and to put 
 Conclusion
215
resources into understanding and addressing the risks of this technology. Constructive scientific
and public discussion will be essential for societies and policymakers to make the right choices.
For the first time in history, this report and the Interim Report (May 2024) brought together expert
representatives nominated by 30 countries, the OECD, the EU, and the UN, as well as several other
world-leading experts, to provide a shared scientific, evidence-based foundation for these vital
discussions. We continue to disagree on several questions, minor and major, around
general-purpose AI and its capabilities, risks, and risk mitigations. However, we consider this report
essential for improving our collective understanding of general-purpose AI and its potential risks,
and for moving closer towards consensus and effective risk mitigation, to ensure that humanity can
enjoy the benefits of general-purpose AI safely. The stakes are high. We look forward to continuing
this effort.

produce a full ‘AI system’ that is ready for use. For instance, integration might consist in developers
combining a general-purpose AI model with content filters and a user interface to produce a
chatbot application.
Systemic risks: Broader societal risks associated with general-purpose AI development and
deployment, beyond the capabilities of individual models or systems. Examples of systemic risks
range from potential labour market impacts to privacy infringements and environmental harms.
Note that this is different from how ‘systemic risk’ is defined by the AI Act of the European Union.
There, the term refers to “risk that is specific to the high-impact capabilities of general-purpose AI
models, having a significant impact”.
Toxin: A poisonous substance produced by living organisms (such as bacteria, plants, or animals), or
synthetically created to mimic a natural toxin, that can cause illness, harm, or death in other
organisms depending on its potency and the exposure level.
TPU (tensor processing unit): A specialised computer chip, developed by Google for accelerating
machine learning workloads, that is now widely used to handle large-scale computations for
training and running AI models.
Trademark: A symbol, word, or phrase legally registered or established by use to represent a
company or product, distinguishing it from others in the market.
Transformer: A deep learning (neural network) model architecture at the heart of most modern
general-purpose AI models. The transformer architecture has proven particularly efficient at
converting increasingly large amounts of training data and computational power into better model
performance.
Watermark: A subtle, often imperceptible pattern embedded within AI-generated content (such as
text, images, or audio) to indicate its artificial origin, verify its source, or detect potential misuse.
Web crawling: Using an automated program, often called a crawler or bot, to navigate the web, for
the purposes of collecting data from websites. 
 Glossary
228
Weights: Model parameters that represent the strength of connection between nodes in a neural
network. Weights play an important part in determining the output of a model in response to a
given input and are iteratively updated during model training to improve its performance.
Whistleblowing: The disclosing of information, by an individual member of an organisation, about
illegal or unethical activities taking place within the organisation to internal or external authorities or
the public.
Winner takes all: A concept in economics referring to cases in which a single company captures a
very large market share, even if consumers only slightly prefer its products or services over those
of competitors.
Zero-day vulnerability: An undiscovered or unpatched security flaw in software or hardware. As
attackers can already exploit it, developers have ‘zero days’ to fix it.
