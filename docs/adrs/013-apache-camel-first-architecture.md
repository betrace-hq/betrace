# ADR-013: Apache Camel-First Architecture

## Status
✅ **IMPLEMENTED** (Updated 2025-09-26)

## Context

BeTrace is fundamentally an Apache Camel application designed for OpenTelemetry data processing and behavioral assurance. The architecture has been successfully unified to use Apache Camel routes exclusively for all web endpoints, eliminating JAX-RS controllers and establishing consistent patterns for route development, processor extraction, and comprehensive testing.

Apache Camel excels at:
- **Integration patterns**: Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) for complex data flows
- **Protocol abstraction**: Unified component model for different protocols and data sources
- **Testability**: Built-in testing framework with MockEndpoint and route testing capabilities
- **Scalability**: Thread pools, async processing, and load balancing patterns
- **Composability**: Routes can be composed, split, and aggregated with clear separation of concerns
- **Monitoring**: Built-in metrics, health checks, and management capabilities

## Decision

**All web endpoints in BeTrace shall be served exclusively through Apache Camel routes. JAX-RS controllers shall not be used for serving web routes.**

For any new endpoint requirement:
1. **First choice**: Implement as a Camel route using existing Camel components
2. **If no suitable component exists**: Implement a custom Camel processor or endpoint
3. **Never**: Implement as a JAX-RS controller for web serving

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Route Definition**: All HTTP endpoints defined using Camel's REST DSL
2. **Processing Logic**: Business logic implemented as Camel processors or beans
3. **Error Handling**: Use Camel's error handling and dead letter patterns
4. **Testing**: Use Camel's testing framework for route testing
5. **Configuration**: Route configuration through Camel properties

## Rationale

### 1. **Testability**
- **Camel Testing Framework**: Built-in `CamelTestSupport` provides powerful testing capabilities
- **MockEndpoint**: Easy mocking of route endpoints for isolated testing
- **Route Testing**: Test individual routes without starting full application context
- **Assertion Framework**: Rich set of assertions for message content, headers, and routing

```java
@Test
public void testSignalProcessingRoute() {
    MockEndpoint mockResult = getMockEndpoint("mock:result");
    mockResult.expectedMessageCount(1);

    template.sendBody("direct:processSignal", testSignal);

    mockResult.assertIsSatisfied();
}
```

### 2. **Scalability**
- **Thread Pool Management**: Camel provides sophisticated thread pool management
- **Async Processing**: Native support for asynchronous processing patterns
- **Load Balancing**: Built-in load balancing strategies (round-robin, failover, etc.)
- **Throttling**: Rate limiting and throttling capabilities
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fault tolerance patterns built-in

```java
from("rest:post:/signals")
    .threads(10, 50) // Thread pool configuration
    .loadBalance().roundRobin()
    .to("direct:processSignal")
    .to("direct:persistSignal");
```

### 3. **Separation of Functionality**
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each route has a specific responsibility
- **Loose Coupling**: Routes communicate through well-defined message contracts
- **Single Responsibility**: Each processor handles one specific transformation
- **Enterprise Integration Patterns**: Standard patterns for routing, transformation, etc.

```java
// Signal processing pipeline with clear separation
from("rest:post:/otlp/traces")
    .to("direct:validateTrace")
    .to("direct:transformToSignal")
    .to("direct:evaluateRules")
    .to("direct:persistToTigerBeetle");
```

### 4. **Composability**
- **Route Composition**: Routes can be easily composed and reused
- **Content-Based Routing**: Dynamic routing based on message content
- **Aggregation Patterns**: Combine multiple messages into single processing units
- **Split Patterns**: Break complex messages into smaller, manageable parts

```java
// Composable route for rule evaluation
from("direct:evaluateRules")
    .split(header("activeRules"))
    .to("direct:evaluateSingleRule")
    .aggregate(header("traceId"), new SignalAggregationStrategy())
    .to("direct:generateSignal");
```

### 5. **Monitoring and Management**
- **Built-in Metrics**: Route-level metrics and performance monitoring
- **Health Checks**: Automatic health check endpoints
- **Management Console**: HawtIO integration for route visualization
- **JMX Integration**: Full JMX support for runtime management

## Benefits

### Technical Benefits
1. **Consistent Architecture**: Single integration framework across all endpoints
2. **Better Error Handling**: Standardized error handling and recovery patterns
3. **Protocol Independence**: Easy to change protocols (HTTP, JMS, etc.) without logic changes
4. **Performance**: Camel's optimized message processing and routing
5. **Observability**: Built-in tracing, metrics, and logging

### Development Benefits
1. **Simplified Testing**: Unified testing approach across all routes
2. **Code Reusability**: Processors and routes can be easily reused
3. **Clear Documentation**: Route definitions serve as living documentation
4. **Debugging**: Visual route debugging through management console

### Operational Benefits
1. **Scalability**: Proven enterprise scalability patterns
2. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Built-in circuit breakers and failover mechanisms
4. **Configuration Management**: Dynamic route configuration and management

## Implementation Status ✅ COMPLETE

### ✅ Phase 1: New Development (Complete)
- All endpoints implemented as Camel routes using REST DSL
- Zero JAX-RS controllers for web serving
- Named processor pattern established for testability

### ✅ Phase 2: Processor Extraction (Complete)
- Systematic extraction of inline lambda processors to CDI beans
- Named processor pattern for better testability and monitoring
- Package organization with clear separation of concerns

### ✅ Phase 3: Comprehensive Testing (Complete)
- Route testing using simplified Camel context testing
- Processor unit testing with 100% coverage achieved
- Integration testing for complete route flows
- Property-based testing for security guarantees

## Implemented Patterns

### 1. Named Processor Pattern
**Problem**: Inline lambda processors in routes are difficult to test and reuse.

**Solution**: Extract processors as named CDI beans.

```java
// Before: Inline lambda (hard to test)
from("direct:workosLogin")
    .process(exchange -> {
        // Complex OAuth logic here...
    });

// After: Named processor (easily testable)
from("direct:workosLogin")
    .process("workosLoginProcessor");

@Named("workosLoginProcessor")
@ApplicationScoped
public class LoginProcessor implements Processor {
    @Override
    public void process(Exchange exchange) throws Exception {
        // OAuth logic with full testability
    }
}
```

### 2. Package Organization Standard
Routes are organized with clear separation of concerns:

```
com.betrace.routes/          # Route definitions (RouteBuilder extensions)
├── WorkOSAuthRoutes.java # OAuth authentication routes
├── TenantRoute.java      # Tenant management routes
└── SpanApiRoute.java     # OTLP/Span processing routes

com.betrace.security/        # Authentication and authorization
├── WorkOSProcessors.java # OAuth-specific processors
└── TenantSecurityProcessor.java

com.betrace.processors/      # Business logic processors
├── SpanApiProcessors.java
└── TenantRouteProcessors.java
```

### 3. Route Testing Pattern
Routes are tested for configuration correctness without requiring processor implementations:

```java
@Test
void testRouteConfiguration() throws Exception {
    CamelContext testContext = new DefaultCamelContext();
    testContext.addRoutes(workOSAuthRoutes);

    // Verify routes can be added without starting context
    assertDoesNotThrow(() -> testContext.addRoutes(workOSAuthRoutes));
}
```

### 4. Processor Testing Pattern
Processors are unit tested with full coverage:

```java
@Test
void testLoginProcessor() throws Exception {
    WorkOSProcessors.LoginProcessor processor = new WorkOSProcessors.LoginProcessor();
    Exchange exchange = new DefaultExchange(camelContext);

    processor.process(exchange);

    assertEquals(302, exchange.getIn().getHeader(Exchange.HTTP_RESPONSE_CODE));
    assertNotNull(exchange.getIn().getHeader("Location"));
}
```

## Example Implementation

### Before (JAX-RS Controller)
```java
@Path("/signals")
@ApplicationScoped
public class SignalController {
    @GET
    public Response getSignals() {
        // Controller logic
    }
}
```

### After (Camel Route)
```java
@ApplicationScoped
public class SignalRoute extends RouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() {
        rest("/signals")
            .get()
            .to("direct:getSignals");

        from("direct:getSignals")
            .process(new SignalProcessor())
            .marshal().json();
    }
}
```

## Exceptions

The following components may retain JAX-RS annotations but should not serve web routes:
1. **Health Check Endpoints**: Quarkus-managed health endpoints
2. **Metrics Endpoints**: Prometheus/Micrometer endpoints managed by Quarkus
3. **OpenAPI Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI endpoints
