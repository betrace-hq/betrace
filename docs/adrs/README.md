# FLUO Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records documenting the technical decisions behind FLUO's design and implementation.

## Current Architecture Status

**FLUO** is a **Pure Application Framework** - deployment-agnostic applications that export packages, not infrastructure.

## ADR Template

Use the following template when creating new ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

**Status:** [Proposed/Accepted/Superseded/Deprecated]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders:** [Architecture Team/Individual Names]

## Context

Describe the context and problem statement that led to this decision.

### Problem Statement

What specific problems are we trying to solve?

## Decision

What decision was made and how it will be implemented.

## Alternatives Considered

What other options were evaluated?

## Consequences

### Positive
- Benefits of this decision

### Negative
- Drawbacks or limitations

### Mitigation Strategies
- How negative consequences will be addressed

## Implementation Status

Current status and next steps.

## References

- Links to relevant documentation, discussions, or related ADRs
```

## Contributing

When proposing new architectural decisions:

1. **Create a new ADR** using the template above
2. **Discuss with the team** before marking as "Accepted"
3. **Update this index** with the new ADR
4. **Cross-reference** related ADRs when applicable
5. **Update CLAUDE.md** files if the decision affects development guidance

## Development Quick Start

```bash
# Start complete development environment
git clone <repository>
cd fluo
nix run .#dev

# Services available:
# Frontend:     http://localhost:3000
# Backend API:  http://localhost:8080
# Grafana:      http://localhost:12015
```

## Current Implementation

### âœ… Pure Application Framework
- **Frontend**: React + Tanstack + Vite
- **Backend**: Quarkus API (Java 21)
- **Development Observability**: Grafana, Loki, Tempo, Prometheus, Pyroscope, Alloy
- **Build System**: Nix Flakes for reproducible builds
- **Supply Chain Security**: All dependencies locked with cryptographic hashes

### âœ… Core Principles
- **Deployment Agnostic**: Applications export packages, not infrastructure
- **Local Development First**: Instant startup with `nix run .#dev`
- **Reproducible Builds**: Nix-based dependency management
- **Hot Reload**: Both frontend and backend support live reload
- **No Infrastructure Dependencies**: External consumers handle deployment

## Architectural Principles

The current ADRs reflect FLUO's evolved architectural principles:

- **Pure Applications**: Deployment-agnostic with external orchestration
- **Reproducible Builds**: Nix-based dependency management with supply chain security
- **Quality Standards**: 90% instruction coverage, conventional commits, code review
- **Local Development**: Rich local development experience with observability stack
