# ADR-012: Mathematical Tenant Isolation Architecture

## Status
**In Progress** - 2025-01-05

## Context

BeTrace requires mathematically provable tenant isolation guarantees to ensure cross-tenant data access is impossible. This isolation must work across multiple system layers and maintain security guarantees even under high load and at massive scale.

The system processes OpenTelemetry spans and transforms them into immutable financial-grade storage while providing comprehensive observability metrics across three tiers: Platform, Tenant, and Business.

## Decision

We implement a **Mathematical Tenant Isolation Architecture** with the following core components:

### 1. Cryptographic Account Isolation

### 2. Disjoint Key Space Isolation

### 3. Multi-Layer Security Boundaries

### 4. Immutable Financial-Grade Storage

### 5. Three-Tier Observability System
- **Platform Metrics**: System health, performance, and infrastructure
- **Tenant Metrics**: Per-tenant usage, behavior, and resource consumption
- **Business Metrics**: Domain-specific KPIs and business value indicators
