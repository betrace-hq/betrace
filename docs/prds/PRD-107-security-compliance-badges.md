# PRD-107: Security & Compliance Badges

**Status:** DRAFT
**Priority:** P1 (Trust & Credibility)
**Created:** 2025-10-12
**Estimated Effort:** 2 days

## Context

Security and compliance badges are trust signals for B2B SaaS:
- Reduce objections during evaluation ("Is this secure?")
- Address buying committee concerns (InfoSec, Legal, Compliance teams)
- Demonstrate proactive security posture
- SEO value (schema markup for certifications)

**Critical for FLUO:** Handling sensitive telemetry data requires strong security messaging.

## Problem Statement

Without security/compliance badges, prospects:
1. Question FLUO's security posture ("Can I trust this with production traces?")
2. Delay evaluation pending InfoSec review (weeks-long blocker)
3. Request detailed security questionnaires (sales friction)
4. Choose competitors with visible certifications

**Result:** Lost deals, longer sales cycles, InfoSec objections.

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Build Trust**: Display security/compliance status prominently
2. **Reduce Objections**: Address InfoSec concerns proactively
3. **Honest Transparency**: Show current status + roadmap (no false claims)
4. **SEO Value**: Rank for "secure observability," "compliant telemetry"

### Success Metrics
- Security objections: 40% reduction in InfoSec questions
- Time-to-evaluation: 30% faster (fewer security blockers)
- Conversion lift: +10% for prospects viewing security page
- SEO: Top 10 for "secure behavioral assurance"

## Proposed Solution

### Badge Categories

#### 1. Security Posture Badges
#### 2. Compliance Framework Badges
#### 3. Development Quality Badges
#### 4. Architecture Transparency Badges

## Badge Display Strategy

### Placement on Marketing Site

#### Landing Page (PRD-100)
**Location:** Below hero section, before use cases
**Format:** Horizontal badge row (6-8 badges visible)
**Design:** Subtle, not overwhelming

```
[Security Expert 9.5/10] [SOC2 Controls] [HIPAA Ready]
[90% Test Coverage] [Open Architecture] [Signed Evidence]
```

#### Dedicated Security Page
**URL:** `/security`
**Content:**
- All badges with detailed descriptions
- Link to full security review
- Contact InfoSec team CTA

#### Footer (All Pages)
**Format:** Compact badge row
**Purpose:** Persistent trust signals

### Badge Visual Design

**Style Guidelines:**
- **Size:** 120px x 40px (standard badge dimensions)
- **Colors:** Match FLUO brand (blues, grays)
- **Icons:** Simple, recognizable (shield, lock, checkmark)
- **Hover State:** Tooltip with 1-sentence description

**Example Badge:**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ 🛡️  Security Expert     │
│     9.5/10 Rating       │
└─────────────────────────┘
  [Hover: Audited by independent security experts]
```

## Honest Transparency Strategy

**Critical Principle:** Never claim certification FLUO doesn't have.

### Compliant Messaging

**✅ Good (Honest):**
- "Built with SOC2 controls"
- "SOC2 compliance-ready architecture"
- "Implements SOC2 Trust Service Criteria"
- "Path to SOC2 certification (12-18 months)"

**❌ Bad (Misleading):**
- "SOC2 certified" (requires external audit)
- "SOC2 compliant" (requires certification)
- "HIPAA compliant" (requires BAA + attestation)

### Transparency Badge: "Compliance Status"
**Visual:** Info icon
**Text:** "View Certification Roadmap"
**Link:** `compliance-status.md`

**Description:**
```markdown
FLUO is NOT currently certified for any compliance framework.

**What FLUO Provides:**
✅ Compliance evidence collection primitives
✅ Built with SOC2/HIPAA controls in mind
✅ Cryptographic signatures for tamper-evidence

**Path to Certification:**
❌ Requires external auditor (12-18 months)
❌ $10-25K audit fees
❌ 6-12 month observation period

We're transparent about where we are.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Badge Design (1 day)
1. Create badge SVGs (8-10 badges)
2. Design hover tooltips
3. Create mobile-responsive layout
4. Define color scheme (match brand)

### Phase 2: Content Writing (Half day)
1. Write detailed descriptions for each badge
2. Create dedicated security page (`/security`)
3. Write FAQ section ("Is FLUO SOC2 certified?")
4. Review with legal team (ensure no false claims)

### Phase 3: Integration (Half day)
1. Add badges to landing page (PRD-100)
2. Create security page template
3. Add footer badges (all pages)
4. Link badges to supporting documentation

### Phase 4: Schema Markup (Half day)
1. Add structured data for certifications
2. Submit to Google Search Console
3. Test rich results display
4. Monitor SEO impact

---

## Testing Strategy

### Legal Review
- **Compliance Claims:** Ensure no false certification claims
- **Trademark Usage:** Verify SOC2/HIPAA logo usage rights
- **Disclaimer Language:** "Not certified" messaging is clear

**Success Criteria:**
- Legal team approves all badge claims
- No trademark violations

### User Testing
- **5 InfoSec Professionals:** "Do these badges build trust?"
- **3 Compliance Officers:** "Is the transparency helpful or concerning?"

**Success Criteria:**
- 8/10 InfoSec professionals find badges credible
- 3/3 compliance officers appreciate honest transparency

### Conversion Testing
- **A/B Test:** Badges on landing page vs no badges
  - Metric: Trial signup conversion rate
  - Hypothesis: Badges increase conversion by 10%+

---

## Dependencies

- **PRD-100**: Landing page displays badges
- **compliance-status.md**: Source of truth for claims
- **Security Reviews**: PRD-003, PRD-005 (completed implementations)

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: False certification claims (legal liability)
**Mitigation:** Legal review all claims, link to transparent status page

### Risk: Badges feel like marketing fluff (no substance)
**Mitigation:** Link every badge to technical documentation, ADRs, PRDs

### Risk: InfoSec teams want more detail than badges provide
**Mitigation:** Dedicated security page with architecture docs, security reviews

### Risk: Competitors claim certifications FLUO doesn't have
**Mitigation:** Position transparency as differentiator ("Honest about status")

## Open Questions

1. Should we use official SOC2/HIPAA logos or generic text badges?
   - **Recommendation:** Text badges (avoid trademark issues) until certified

2. Should badges link externally (e.g., to audit reports)?
   - **Recommendation:** Link internally to `compliance-status.md` (control narrative)

3. Should we show "In Progress" badges for roadmap items?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes, but clearly labeled ("Roadmap: PII Redaction")

4. Should security page be gated (require email to view)?
   - **Recommendation:** Ungated (transparency builds trust, gating reduces it)

## Success Criteria

- ✅ 8-10 security/compliance badges displayed
- ✅ Legal approval on all claims
- ✅ Security objections reduced by 40%
- ✅ Dedicated security page created (`/security`)
- ✅ Conversion lift: +10% for prospects viewing badges
