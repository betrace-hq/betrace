# PRD-110: Zero-Budget Marketing Strategy

**Status:** DRAFT
**Priority:** P0 (Replaces Paid Marketing Approach)
**Created:** 2025-10-12
**Estimated Effort:** Ongoing
**Budget:** ~$0 (AI tools + time only)

## Context

**Revised Constraint:** Near-zero sales/marketing budget.

**New Strategy:**
1. **AI-Driven Content Creation** - Use Claude/GPT-4 to write blog posts, social copy, docs
2. **Organic Social Media** - LinkedIn, Twitter, HackerNews (no paid ads)
3. **Case Study Trading** - Free/discounted FLUO for testimonials
4. **Community-Led Growth** - Build in public, engage authentically

**Key Principle:** Trade **time & expertise** for **visibility & social proof** instead of cash for ads.

## Revised PRD Priorities

### Keep (Zero-Cost):
- ✅ **PRD-100**: Landing page (self-built, no agency)
- ✅ **PRD-101**: Interactive demo (use FLUO's own frontend, skip Navattic)
- ✅ **PRD-102**: Documentation (Docusaurus, self-hosted)
- ✅ **PRD-103**: Use cases (AI-written, no contractors)
- ✅ **PRD-105**: Comparison pages (AI-written)
- ✅ **PRD-106**: Case study templates (trade FLUO for testimonials)
- ✅ **PRD-109**: Content marketing (AI-written, organic promotion)

### Cut/Defer (Costs Money):
- ❌ **PRD-104**: ROI Calculator (nice-to-have, defer to Phase 2)
- ❌ **PRD-107**: Security badges (free, but lower priority than content)
- ❌ **PRD-108**: Multi-path funnel (optimize later, start simple)

### New Additions:
- ➕ **PRD-110**: AI-driven social media engine (this document)
- ➕ **PRD-111**: Case study trading program
- ➕ **PRD-112**: Community engagement playbook

## Strategy 1: AI-Driven Content & Social Media

### AI Content Creation Workflow

#### Tools (Free/Low-Cost)
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (you have access) - Long-form content, technical depth
- **ChatGPT-4o** ($20/month) - Social media copy, repurposing
- **Midjourney** ($10/month, optional) - Diagrams, visuals
- **Canva Free** - Social media graphics

**Total Cost:** $0-30/month

#### Content Production Pipeline

**Step 1: Weekly Blog Post (AI-Written)**
```
Prompt to Claude:
"Write a 1,500-word blog post for FLUO (behavioral assurance system for OpenTelemetry).

Target audience: SREs, DevOps engineers
Topic: [e.g., 'How to Detect Missing Auth Checks in OpenTelemetry Traces']
Tone: Technical, honest, helpful (not salesy)
Include: Code examples, FLUO DSL syntax, real-world scenario
SEO keyword: 'opentelemetry pattern detection'

Structure:
- Problem statement (what breaks without this pattern)
- Solution (how FLUO detects it)
- Implementation (step-by-step with code)
- Results (quantified improvement)

CTA: 'Try FLUO: github.com/fluohq/fluo'"
```

**Output:** Publish-ready blog post in 10 minutes (vs 4 hours manual writing)

**Step 2: Repurpose Blog → Social Media (AI-Driven)**
```
Prompt to ChatGPT:
"Turn this blog post into:
1. LinkedIn post (200 words, professional tone)
2. Twitter thread (8 tweets, technical but accessible)
3. HackerNews submission title + comment
4. Reddit r/devops post (900 chars, helpful not spammy)

Blog URL: [link]
Key takeaway: [one sentence]"
```

**Output:** 4 social posts in 5 minutes (vs 1 hour manual)

**Step 3: Create Visual (AI-Assisted)**
```
Canva Free:
- Use template: "LinkedIn Post - Tech"
- Add headline: "3 OpenTelemetry Patterns Every SRE Should Know"
- Add FLUO logo, brand colors
- Export PNG
```

**Output:** Social media graphic in 5 minutes

**Total Time Per Blog Post:** 20 minutes (AI-assisted) vs 5 hours (manual)

- "We use AI (Claude) to write docs. Here's our workflow." (meta, transparent)

**Share Learnings:**
- "5 things we learned building a DSL for trace pattern matching"
- "Why we chose capability-based security over Java SecurityManager"
- "Our test coverage is 90%. Here's how we maintain it."

**Open Architecture:**
- Link ADRs in every technical post
- Encourage community to read PRDs (show this approach)
- "Our roadmap is public. Here's what we're building next."

---

### Engagement Tactics (Zero-Cost)

#### HackerNews Strategy
**Best Practices:**
- Submit Tuesdays 8am PT (highest engagement)
- Title format: "Show HN: FLUO – Behavioral Assurance for OpenTelemetry"
- First comment: Technical deep dive (not marketing)
- Engage authentically in comments (provide value)

**Content Types That Work:**
- Technical deep dives ("How we built X")
- Controversial takes ("Observability is broken, here's why")
- Open source announcements ("FLUO is now open source")

#### Reddit Strategy
**Subreddits:**

- r/sre (50K members) - Technical depth, MTTR reduction
- r/opentelemetry (5K members) - Integration guides
- r/programming (7M members) - Architecture decisions

**Rules:**
- Provide value first (answer questions, share learnings)
- Post ratio: 10 helpful comments : 1 promotional post
- Be transparent: "I built FLUO, here's what we learned"

#### LinkedIn Strategy
**Profile Optimization:**
- Headline: "Building FLUO | Behavioral Assurance for OpenTelemetry"
- About: Link to blog, GitHub, ADRs
- Featured: Pin top 3 blog posts

**Posting Strategy:**
- Personal voice (founder account, not company page)
- Share behind-the-scenes (ADRs, PRD process, AI workflow)
- Engage with SRE/DevOps influencers (comment genuinely)

#### Twitter/X Strategy
**Profile:**
- Bio: "Building FLUO – pattern detection for OpenTelemetry traces | SRE tools | Open architecture"
- Pinned tweet: Link to best blog post or demo

**Tactics:**
- Technical threads (6-8 tweets, code examples)
- Quote tweet OpenTelemetry news (add FLUO perspective)
- Engage with #SREcon, #ObservabilitySummit hashtags

## Key Tactics Summary

### Do More Of (Zero-Cost, High-Impact):
1. ✅ **AI-written content** (1 blog post/week, 20 min effort)
2. ✅ **Organic social media** (LinkedIn, Twitter, HackerNews)
3. ✅ **Case study trading** (free FLUO for testimonials)
4. ✅ **Build in public** (share ADRs, PRDs, honest status)
5. ✅ **Community engagement** (answer questions, provide value)

### Do Less Of (Costs Money, Lower ROI):
1. ❌ **Paid ads** (defer until PMF validated)
2. ❌ **Agencies/contractors** (do it yourself with AI)
3. ❌ **Paid tools** (Navattic, Ahrefs, etc.)
4. ❌ **Complex funnels** (start simple, optimize later)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: AI-generated content feels generic
**Mitigation:** Add personal voice, real examples from FLUO development, technical depth

### Risk: No customers willing to trade for case studies
**Mitigation:** Offer more value (consulting, custom features), start with anonymized testimonials

### Risk: Organic social media is slow (3-6 months to see results)
**Mitigation:** Consistency is key, engage daily, provide value (not just promotion)

### Risk: Building in public reveals competitive info
**Mitigation:** Share learnings, not secrets; differentiation is execution, not ideas

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ 20 MQLs/month from organic (6 months)
- ✅ 5 case studies with quantified results
- ✅ 2,000 organic visits/month
- ✅ 500 LinkedIn followers, 100 newsletter subscribers
- ✅ 2 HackerNews front-page posts
