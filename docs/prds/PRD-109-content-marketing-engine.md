# PRD-109: Content Marketing Engine

**Status:** DRAFT
**Priority:** P2 (Inbound Lead Generation)
**Created:** 2025-10-12
**Estimated Effort:** 2 weeks initial setup + ongoing

## Context

Content marketing drives inbound B2B SaaS leads:
- 82% of B2B marketers use content marketing (Content Marketing Institute 2025)
- Median ROI: $3 earned for every $1 spent
- Technical content (blogs, guides, tutorials) ranks for long-tail keywords
- Establishes thought leadership in emerging space (behavioral assurance)

**FLUO Advantage:** Behavioral assurance is a **new category** → opportunity to own search terms.

## Problem Statement

Without content marketing, FLUO:
1. Relies on paid acquisition only (expensive, not scalable)
2. Misses organic search traffic (0% visibility for key terms)
3. Has no thought leadership presence (competitors dominate conversation)
4. Can't nurture early-stage leads (no educational content)

**Result:** High customer acquisition cost (CAC), low brand awareness.

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Organic Traffic Growth**: 1,000 monthly organic visits within 6 months
2. **Thought Leadership**: Establish FLUO as authority on behavioral assurance
3. **Lead Generation**: 50 MQLs per month from content
4. **SEO Dominance**: Top 10 for 20+ behavioral assurance keywords

### Success Metrics (6 Month Targets)
- Organic traffic: 1,000 visits/month
- Content-driven leads: 50 MQLs/month
- Keyword rankings: Top 10 for 20+ terms
- Social shares: 500 total (LinkedIn + Twitter)

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: Low organic traffic (slow SEO growth)
**Mitigation:** Focus on distribution (LinkedIn, HackerNews), don't rely solely on SEO

### Risk: Content doesn't resonate (low engagement)
**Mitigation:** User testing (5 SREs review before publish), iterate based on analytics

### Risk: Inconsistent publishing (quality drops)
**Mitigation:** 3-month content calendar, batch-write posts in advance

### Risk: High cost per lead ($148/MQL)
**Mitigation:** Optimize CTAs, improve lead capture, refine nurture campaigns

## Open Questions

1. Should blog be subdomain (`blog.fluo.com`) or subdirectory (`fluo.com/blog`)?
   - **Recommendation:** Subdirectory (better SEO, unified domain authority)

2. Should content be gated (email required) or ungated?
   - **Recommendation:** Ungated blog posts, gated whitepapers/guides (hybrid)

3. Should we accept guest posts from community?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes, vet for quality, require technical accuracy

4. Should we create video content immediately?
   - **Recommendation:** Phase 2 (after blog traction), focus on written content first

## Success Criteria

- ✅ 1,000 organic visits/month (6 months)
- ✅ 50 MQLs/month from content
- ✅ Top 10 for 20+ behavioral assurance keywords
