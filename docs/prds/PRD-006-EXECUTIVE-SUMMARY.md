## What Was Built

**5 Core Services**:
1. KeyCache - Caffeine-based caching (<1ms retrieval)
2. KeyRetrievalService - Cache-first key retrieval
3. KeyGenerationService - KMS-agnostic key generation
4. KeyRotationScheduler - Automated 90-day rotation
5. ComplianceSigningService - Integration with PRD-003

**5 KMS Providers**: AWS, Vault, GCP, Azure, Local (dev only)

**Test Coverage**: 21 tests, 90%+ instruction coverage, all passing ✅

## Review Status: ALL APPROVED

| Stakeholder | Status | Key Concern |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Security Officer | ✅ APPROVED | Cryptographic isolation excellent |
| Tech Lead | ✅ APPROVED | Architecture is sound |
| Engineering Manager | ✅ APPROVED | Team capacity manageable |
| SRE | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL | **Needs observability (2-3 days)** |
| Product Manager | ✅ APPROVED | High ROI, ship immediately |
| Business Analyst | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL | **Needs evidence export (Q1 2026)** |
| Customer Success | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL | **Needs documentation (1-2 weeks)** |

**Overall**: 4 unconditional approvals, 3 conditional approvals

## P0 Blockers (3-4 weeks)

### 1. SRE Observability (2-3 days, $7K)
**CRITICAL - Cannot deploy without this**

- [ ] Add Prometheus metrics (cache hit rate, KMS latency)
- [ ] Configure 4 alerts (cache, KMS errors, rotation, latency)
- [ ] Write 3 runbooks (KMS failure, rotation failure, cache issues)
- [ ] Add circuit breaker (SmallRye Fault Tolerance)
- [ ] Add health check endpoint (`GET /health/kms`)

**Why Critical**: No way to detect/respond to production incidents without this.

### 2. Customer Documentation (1-2 weeks, $5K)
**HIGH PRIORITY - Customers can't use it without this**

- [ ] KMS Quickstart Guide (30-minute tutorial)
- [ ] AWS KMS Setup Guide (step-by-step with screenshots)
- [ ] Troubleshooting Guide (top 10 errors + solutions)
- [ ] Terraform IAM policy templates
- [ ] 5 knowledge base articles for support

**Why Important**: Prevents support overload and customer abandonment.

### 3. Error Handling Improvements (2-3 days, $3K)
**MEDIUM PRIORITY - Prevents security incidents**

- [ ] Remove silent fallback to LocalKmsAdapter (fail-fast)
- [ ] Improve error messages (include docs links)
- [ ] Add admin validation endpoint (`POST /admin/validate-kms`)

**Why Important**: Silent fallback to dev mode in production = SOC2 violation.

## Business Case

### Benefits (Annual)

**Revenue Impact**:
- Unblocks $50K+ Enterprise tier sales
- 3-5x ACV expansion for Team → Enterprise upgrades
- Qualifies for 2-5 enterprise RFPs/year ($50-100K each)

**Compliance Value**:
- Enables SOC2 Type II certification (6-9 months faster)
- Satisfies HIPAA technical safeguards
- Reduces regulatory risk by $154K-$1.9M (expected value)

**Competitive Advantage**:
- Only behavioral assurance platform with per-tenant BYOK
- Cryptographic evidence integrity (AI Safety Report validation)
- Vendor-agnostic architecture (no lock-in)

### Costs

**Development**:
- Original PRD-006: $18.6K (124 hours)
- P0 blockers: $15.8K (131 hours)
- **Total**: $34.4K (255 hours)

**Operations (Annual)**:
- AWS KMS: $3K (100 tenants)

**Total Year 1**: $37.5K

### ROI

```
Conservative Case:
  Revenue: $100K (2 enterprise deals)
  Cost savings: $65K (SOC2 faster + compliance time)
  Total benefit: $165K

  ROI = ($165K - $37.5K) / $37.5K = 340%
  Payback period: 2.7 months
```

## Timeline

### Week 1-2: SRE + Engineering (CRITICAL PATH)
- Implement Prometheus metrics and alerts
- Add circuit breaker and health checks
- Write runbooks for on-call team
- **Deliverable**: Production-ready observability

### Week 2-3: CS + PM
- Create customer documentation (3 guides)
- Build Terraform IAM templates
- Write knowledge base articles
- Train support team (3-hour session)
- **Deliverable**: Customer-ready documentation

### Week 4: Internal Pilot
- 5-10 employees test KMS setup
- Validate setup time <1 hour
- Fix documentation gaps
- **Deliverable**: Validated setup experience

### Week 5-6: Public Launch
- Announce to existing customers
- Publish blog post and webinar
- Update sales materials
- **Deliverable**: General availability

---

## Success Metrics

### Technical (SRE)
- Cache hit rate: >80%
- KMS operation success rate: >99%
- p99 latency: <5ms (cache), <200ms (KMS)

### Business (PM)
- 50% of new deals at Enterprise tier (vs. 20% baseline)
- 3-5x ACV expansion (Team → Enterprise)
- 5+ AI safety pilot customers (90 days)

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Timeline slippage** | Delayed revenue | Start SRE work immediately |
| **Documentation insufficient** | Support overload | Test with 3 engineers, iterate |
| **AWS KMS costs exceed budget** | Margin pressure | Enforce 80% cache hit rate |
| **Silent fallback to local mode** | SOC2 violation | Fail-fast validation (P0) |

---

## Decision Required

**Question**: Should we proceed with P0 blocker implementation?

**Recommendation**: ✅ **YES - START IMMEDIATELY**

**Rationale**:
1. All stakeholders have approved (conditional on P0 work)
2. 3-4 week timeline is acceptable (production-ready mid-November)
3. ROI remains excellent (340% even with P0 costs)
4. Blocks SOC2 certification path if delayed

**Next Step**: Assign engineering resources to SRE observability (critical path)
