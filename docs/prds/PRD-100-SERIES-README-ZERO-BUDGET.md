### ❌ Cut/Defer (Costs Money or Time)

#### PRD-104: ROI Calculator
- **Reason:** Nice-to-have, not critical for early traction
- **Defer to:** Phase 2 (after 10 case studies)

#### PRD-107: Security Badges
- **Reason:** Lower priority than content generation
- **Defer to:** Phase 2 (after blog has 20 posts)

#### PRD-108: Multi-Path Funnel
- **Reason:** Optimize later, start with simple funnel
- **Defer to:** Phase 3 (after 100 MQLs)
