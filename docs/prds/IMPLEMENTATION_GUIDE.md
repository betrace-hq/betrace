# FLUO Implementation Guide

This guide explains how to use the PRD system to build FLUO to production readiness.

## Overview

FLUO requires **27 PRDs** to reach production readiness, organized into 5 waves over ~16 weeks.

## PRD System Created

‚úÖ **Established:**
- `PRD_ROADMAP.md` - Complete index of all 27 PRDs with dependencies
- `README.md` - How to use and contribute PRDs
- `001-authentication-authorization.md` - First foundational PRD (complete example)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - This file

## How to Implement

### Step 1: Review the Roadmap
Read `PRD_ROADMAP.md` to understand the full scope and waves.

### Step 2: Implement in Order
Start with PRD-001 and proceed sequentially. Each PRD lists its dependencies.

### Step 3: Mark Progress
Update `README.md` status as PRDs are completed:
```markdown
- ‚úÖ PRD-001: Authentication & Authorization System
- üöß PRD-002: Persistence Layer (In Progress)
- ‚è≥ PRD-003: Compliance Span Cryptographic Signing
```

### Step 4: Verify Success Criteria
Each PRD has success criteria checkboxes. All must pass before moving to next PRD.

### Step 5: Write Tests First
Each PRD specifies testing requirements. Implement tests before or alongside features.

## Wave Breakdown

**Wave 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)**
- PRD 001-007: Security, auth, persistence, compliance, KMS
- **Output:** Secure, multi-tenant backend with persistence

**Wave 2: Core Features (Weeks 5-8)**
- PRD 008-012: Signals, traces, rules, investigation, tenants
- **Output:** Working FLUO system with basic UI

**Wave 3: User Workflows (Weeks 9-12)**
- PRD 013-017: Dashboards, testing, compliance, alerts
- **Output:** Complete workflows for all three personas

**Wave 4: Production Hygiene (Weeks 13-16)**
- PRD 018-022: Tests, observability, performance, resilience
- **Output:** Production-ready system

**Wave 5: Enhancements (Post-MVP)**
- PRD 023-027: Analytics, integrations, versioning
- **Output:** Polished product with advanced features

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The absolute minimum for a usable FLUO:
- **Foundation:** PRD 001-007 (Security & persistence)
- **Core:** PRD 008-011 (Basic functionality)
- **SRE Workflow:** PRD 013 (Dashboard for incident response)
- **Quality:** PRD 018 (Test suite)

**Total:** 12 PRDs for MVP (~8 weeks)

## Next Steps for Developer

1. **Create remaining PRD files** - Use PRD-001 as template, create 002-027.md files
2. **Assign to implementation team** - Each PRD can be a sprint or epic
3. **Track in project management tool** - Import PRDs as GitHub Issues/Linear tasks
4. **Begin Wave 1** - Start with PRD-001 (Authentication)

## PRD Template Usage

When creating PRD files (002-027), use this template:

```markdown
# PRD-NNN: [Title from Roadmap]

**Priority:** [P0/P1/P2 from Roadmap]
**Complexity:** [Simple/Medium/Complex]
**Personas:** [SRE/Developer/Compliance/All]
**Dependencies:** [List PRD numbers that must complete first]

## Problem
[Describe what's missing or broken. Reference actual files/code where applicable]

## Solution
[Describe what to build. Be specific about backend/frontend/both]

### Backend Changes
- [Bullet points for backend work]

### Frontend Changes
- [Bullet points for frontend work]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] [Testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Testable criterion 2]
- [ ] [etc.]

## Testing Requirements
- [Unit tests needed]
- [Integration tests needed]
- [E2E tests needed]
- [Security tests needed]

## Files to Create/Modify
**Backend:**
- `path/to/new/File.java`

**Frontend:**
- `path/to/new/component.tsx`

## Implementation Notes
[Any architecture decisions, security considerations, performance notes]
```
