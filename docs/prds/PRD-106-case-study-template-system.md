# PRD-106: Case Study Template System

**Status:** DRAFT
**Priority:** P1 (Social Proof & Trust)
**Created:** 2025-10-12
**Estimated Effort:** 3 days

## Context

Case studies are critical for B2B SaaS credibility:
- Provide social proof from real customers
- Show concrete ROI (not just hypothetical)
- Address buying committee concerns (proven results)
- SEO value (long-tail keywords like "opentelemetry compliance case study")

**Challenge:** FLUO is pre-launch, no customer case studies yet.

**Solution:** Create template system ready to populate as customers adopt FLUO.

## Problem Statement

Without case studies, prospects lack:
1. Social proof ("Has anyone actually used this?")
2. Real-world validation ("Does FLUO deliver on promises?")
3. Industry-specific examples ("Does it work for healthcare/finance/e-commerce?")
4. Measurable outcomes ("What ROI did customers achieve?")

**Result:** Skepticism, longer sales cycles, lower close rates.

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Structured Template**: Repeatable format for all case studies
2. **Quantifiable Results**: Framework for capturing metrics
3. **Multi-Persona Appeal**: Address SRE, developer, and compliance concerns
4. **SEO Optimization**: Rank for industry-specific searches

### Success Metrics (When Case Studies Exist)
- Case study page views: >15% of landing page traffic
- Case study-to-trial conversion: >20%
- Sales close rate lift: +15% for prospects who read case studies
- SEO: Top 10 for "[industry] observability case study"

## Proposed Solution

### Case Study Template Structure

```markdown
# [Customer Name] Achieves [Outcome] with FLUO

## Company Overview
- **Industry:** [Healthcare/Finance/E-commerce/SaaS]
- **Company Size:** [50-200/200-1000/1000+ employees]
- **Engineering Team:** [10-50/50-200/200+ engineers]
- **Tech Stack:** [Java/Go/Python, Kubernetes, OpenTelemetry, etc.]

## The Challenge (Before FLUO)

### Problem Statement
[2-3 paragraphs describing the pain point]

**Key Challenges:**
- Challenge 1: [Specific problem]
- Challenge 2: [Quantified impact]
- Challenge 3: [Business risk]

**Quantified Impact:**
- Incident frequency: [X per month]
- MTTR: [Y hours average]
- Compliance prep time: [Z hours per audit]
- Engineer hours spent debugging: [W hours/month]

### Why Existing Tools Didn't Help
**APM (Datadog/New Relic):**
- ✅ Good for: Error rates, latency monitoring
- ❌ Couldn't detect: Behavioral pattern violations

**Distributed Tracing (Jaeger/Tempo):**
- ✅ Good for: Debugging specific slow requests
- ❌ Couldn't detect: Missing spans, incorrect span order

**Logs (ELK/Splunk):**
- ✅ Good for: Text search
- ❌ Couldn't detect: Cross-span patterns, trace-level invariants

## The Solution (FLUO Implementation)

### Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1:** Connected OpenTelemetry to FLUO
- **Week 2:** Created first 5 rules from historical patterns
- **Week 3:** Refined rules based on signals
- **Week 4:** Integrated FLUO signals with PagerDuty

### Key Rules Deployed
1. **auth-before-data**
   ```
   trace.has(span.name == "authenticate")
     and trace.has(span.name == "database.query")
   ```
   Purpose: Ensure authentication happens before data access

2. **pii-audit-required**
   ```
   trace.has(database.query).where(data.contains_pii == true)
     and trace.has(audit.log)
   ```
   Purpose: Enforce audit logging for PII access (HIPAA compliance)

3. **cache-before-query**
   ```
   trace.has(span.name == "expensive_query")
     and trace.spansBefore("cache.check", "expensive_query")
   ```
   Purpose: Prevent N+1 query performance issues

### Integration with Existing Tools
- FLUO signals → PagerDuty alerts (high-severity violations)
- FLUO compliance spans → Grafana dashboard (audit evidence)
- FLUO rules → Git repository (version-controlled, peer-reviewed)

## The Results (After FLUO)

### Quantifiable Outcomes

**Incident Prevention:**
- Incidents reduced: [X% decrease]
- Before FLUO: [Y incidents/month]
- After FLUO: [Z incidents/month]
- Prevented incidents: [W caught in staging]

**MTTR Improvement:**
- MTTR reduced: [X% decrease]
- Before FLUO: [Y hours average]
- After FLUO: [Z hours average]
- Time saved per incident: [W hours]

**Compliance Efficiency:**
- Audit prep time reduced: [X% decrease]
- Before FLUO: [Y hours per audit]
- After FLUO: [Z hours per audit]
- Evidence collection: [100% automated]

**Development Efficiency:**
- Bugs caught in staging: [X per month]
- Production bugs reduced: [Y% decrease]
- Engineer time saved: [Z hours/month]

- **PRD-103**: Use case library references case studies
- **Early Customers**: Need 3-5 customers willing to participate

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: No customers willing to be case studies (pre-launch)
**Mitigation:** Start with anonymized case studies, use mock data until real customers exist

### Risk: Customers share unimpressive results
**Mitigation:** Choose customers with quantifiable wins, help frame results positively

### Risk: Case studies become outdated (stale metrics)
**Mitigation:** Schedule annual updates, mark case study date prominently

### Risk: Low conversion from case study readers
**Mitigation:** Strong CTAs, gated PDF downloads, multiple conversion paths

## Open Questions

1. Should case studies be gated (email required) or ungated?
   - **Recommendation:** Ungated web page, gated PDF download (hybrid)

2. Should we anonymize customer names early on?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes if needed, but prioritize named customers (higher trust)

3. Should case studies include video testimonials?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes if budget allows (3-5 min YouTube videos)

4. Should we create industry-specific landing pages?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes, `/industries/healthcare` with relevant case studies

## Success Criteria (When Case Studies Exist)

- ✅ 3 published case studies within 6 months of launch
- ✅ Case study-to-trial conversion >20%
- ✅ SEO: Top 10 for 2+ industry-specific keywords
