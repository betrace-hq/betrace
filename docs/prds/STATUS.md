# PRD System Status

## Summary

The FLUO PRD system has been established with a complete roadmap for production readiness.

## What's Been Created

### ✅ Framework Documents
1. **PRD_ROADMAP.md** - Complete index of all 27 PRDs organized into 5 waves
2. **README.md** - How to use the PRD system and template
3. **IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step guide for developers
4. **STATUS.md** - This file

### ✅ Example PRDs (Fully Detailed)
1. **001-authentication-authorization.md** - WorkOS integration, JWT, RBAC (P0, Complex)
2. **002-persistence-layer.md** - PostgreSQL, JPA, Flyway migrations (P0, Complex)

These two PRDs serve as templates showing the expected level of detail for all PRDs.

## PRD Roadmap Overview

**27 Total PRDs** across 5 implementation waves:

###  Wave 1: Foundation (P0) - Weeks 1-4
- 001: Authentication & Authorization ✅ **Created**
- 002: Persistence Layer ✅ **Created**
- 003: Compliance Span Cryptographic Signing
- 004: PII Redaction Enforcement
- 005: Rule Engine Sandboxing
- 006: KMS Integration
- 007: API Input Validation & Rate Limiting

### Wave 2: Core Features (P0) - Weeks 5-8
- 008: Signal Management System
- 009: Trace Ingestion Pipeline
- 010: Rule Management UI
- 011: Signal Investigation Workflow
- 012: Tenant Management System

### Wave 3: User Workflows (P1) - Weeks 9-12
- 013: SRE Dashboard
- 014: Developer Rule Testing
- 015: Compliance Evidence Dashboard
- 016: Audit Report Generation
- 017: Alert & Notification System

### Wave 4: Production Hygiene (P1) - Weeks 13-16
- 018: Comprehensive Test Suite
- 019: Observability for FLUO
- 020: Performance Optimization
- 021: Graceful Degradation
- 022: Backup & Recovery

### Wave 5: Enhancements (P2) - Post-MVP
- 023: Rule Analytics
- 024: Grafana Integration
- 025: CI/CD Integration
- 026: Rule Versioning & Rollback
- 027: Advanced Query Language

## Critical Path to MVP

**Minimum Viable Product** requires 12 PRDs (~8 weeks):

**Foundation (4 weeks):**
- PRD 001-007: Security, auth, persistence, compliance

**Core Features (3 weeks):**
- PRD 008-011: Signals, traces, rules, investigation

**SRE Workflow (1 week):**
- PRD 013: Dashboard for primary use case

**Quality (2 weeks):**
- PRD 018: Test suite to ensure reliability

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Generate Remaining PRD Files
Create PRD files 003-027 using PRD-001 and PRD-002 as templates. Each should include:
- Problem statement
- Detailed solution
- Success criteria
- Testing requirements
- Files to create/modify
- Implementation notes

### Option 2: Start Implementation Immediately
Begin with PRD-001 (Authentication) using the existing detailed specification. Create remaining PRDs as needed (just-in-time approach).

### Option 3: Detailed Planning First
Expand all 27 PRDs to the same level of detail as 001 and 002 before starting implementation. This provides complete clarity but delays development.

## Recommendation

**Hybrid Approach:**
1. Create detailed PRDs for Wave 1 (001-007) - Foundation is critical
2. Start implementing PRD-001 while Wave 1 PRDs are being written
3. Create Wave 2 PRDs while Wave 1 is being implemented
4. Iterate: Always have next wave's PRDs ready before current wave completes

This balances planning with execution and allows learning from implementation to inform later PRDs.

## Dependencies Graph (First 12 PRDs)

001 (Auth)
 └─> 002 (Persistence)
      ├─> 003 (Compliance Signing)
      ├─> 004 (PII Redaction)
      ├─> 005 (Sandboxing)
      ├─> 006 (KMS)
      └─> 007 (Input Validation)

           ├─> 010 (Rule Management UI)
           └─> 011 (Signal Investigation)
                └─> 013 (SRE Dashboard)
                     └─> 018 (Test Suite)
```

All PRDs 003-007 depend on 002 (can be done in parallel after 002)
PRDs 008-011 depend on 007 (can be done in parallel after 007)
PRD 013 depends on 011
PRD 018 should be done continuously but formally completed before launch

## Estimated Timeline

**MVP (12 PRDs):** 8-10 weeks with 2-3 developers
**Full Production (22 PRDs):** 14-16 weeks
**Complete (27 PRDs):** 16-20 weeks with enhancements
