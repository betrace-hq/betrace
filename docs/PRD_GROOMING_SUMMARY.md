# PRD Grooming Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Objective:** Groom all FLUO PRDs to 95%+ implementation specialist confidence
**Initial State:** 0/15 PRDs at 95%+ confidence
**Current State:** 3/15 PRDs at 95%+ confidence (98% each)

---

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive PRD grooming session was conducted with FLUO's team of specialized agents (Product Analyst, Architecture Guardian, Security Expert, QA Expert, Implementation Specialist) to transform ambiguous requirements into actionable, implementable specifications.

**Key Achievement:** The critical security blocker PRD-005 (Rule Engine Sandboxing) went from 60% confidence → 98% confidence with a definitive architectural decision.

## Grooming Results by PRD

### ✅ READY TO IMPLEMENT (95%+ Confidence)

#### 1. PRD-007: API Input Validation & Rate Limiting
**Confidence:** 90% → **98%** ✅
**Priority:** P0 (Security - Blocks Production)
**Implementation Time:** 4 hours

**Key Clarifications:**
- Three-tier rate limiting (tenant: 1000/min, user: 100/min, IP: fallback)
- Sliding window algorithm with Redis atomic operations
- HTTP 429 with `Retry-After` and `X-RateLimit-*` headers
- Quarkus `redis-client` integration with Dev Services
- Named `RateLimitProcessor` after auth/before business logic
- Validation: `@Valid` for DTOs, manual `RuleValidator` for DSL

**Artifacts Created:**
- Redis key schema: `ratelimit:{tenant}:{resource}:{window}`
- Rate limit tiers: free (100/min), paid (10K/min), enterprise (100K/min)
- Complete HTTP response format with headers
- Integration patterns (Camel processors)

**Files to Create:** 4 (RateLimitProcessor, RateLimitService, 2 test files)
**Files to Modify:** 4 (pom.xml, application.properties, RuleValidator, SpanApiRoute)

---

#### 2. PRD-014: Developer Rule Testing
**Confidence:** 90% → **98%** ✅
**Priority:** P1 (User Workflow - Production Use)
**Implementation Time:** 2-3 weeks (4 phases)

**Key Clarifications:**
- Parameterized tests with `{{variable}}` syntax and time expressions
- Hard limit: 1000 spans per trace, 10s timeout, warnings at 500 spans
- Auto-generate tests from production traces WITH PII redaction
- Flaky test detection: 3x retry, flakiness score tracking (<80% pass rate)
- Complete JSON schemas for test fixtures and results
- CI/CD integration: `nix run .#test-rules` with exit code enforcement
- Performance baselines and regression detection (>2x baseline = alert)
- Test coverage metrics and deployment gating (≥1 test required)

**Artifacts Created:**
- Complete JSON schemas (test fixtures, test results)
- API endpoint definitions (7 endpoints: CRUD + execution)
- Database schema (3 tables: tests, results, performance)
- User workflow scenarios (4 documented workflows)
- Test data formats and validation rules

**Implementation Phases:**
1. **Phase 1 (Week 1):** Core test infrastructure + fixture loading
2. **Phase 2 (Week 1-2):** API layer + test execution
3. **Phase 3 (Week 2):** CI/CD integration + coverage
4. **Phase 4 (Week 3):** Auto-generation + PII redaction

#### 3. PRD-005: Rule Engine Sandboxing ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Confidence:** 60% → **98%** ✅
**Priority:** P0 (Security - Blocks Production)
**Implementation Time:** 5 weeks (3 phases)

**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL DECISION:**
- **Mechanism:** Capability-Based Security with Read-Only Proxies
- **NO SecurityManager:** Deprecated in Java 17+, using future-proof approach

**4-Layer Security Architecture:**
1. **Read-Only Proxies:** `SpanCapability`, `SignalCapability`, `SandboxedGlobals`
2. **Per-Tenant KieSession Isolation:** Already implemented, enhanced
3. **Bytecode Validation:** Forbidden imports/methods detection
4. **Resource Limits:** Execution timeout (10s), rule count limits

**Key Implementation Pattern:**
```java
// Rules receive immutable capabilities, not live services
SandboxedGlobals globals = new SandboxedGlobals(signalCapability, tenantId);
session.setGlobal("sandbox", globals);

// Rules call sandboxed API only
sandbox.createSignal("rule-id", "message");
```

**Performance Impact:** 5-10% overhead (acceptable for throughput requirements)

**Artifacts Created:**
- Complete interface definitions (SpanCapability, SignalCapability)
- ImmutableSpanWrapper implementation
- Updated DroolsGenerator patterns
- Security test suite (4 comprehensive tests)
- Migration path (3 phases, 5 weeks)

**Implementation Phases:**
1. **Phase 1 (Week 1-2 - P0):** Capability interfaces + wrappers
2. **Phase 2 (Week 3-4 - P1):** Bytecode validation + resource limits
3. **Phase 3 (Week 5):** Documentation + security tests

**Files to Create:** 15
**Files to Modify:** 3 (DroolsRuleEngine, DroolsGenerator, RuleEvaluationService)

**Why This Matters:**
This was the **LOWEST confidence PRD (60%)** and the highest technical risk. Without a clear sandboxing mechanism, FLUO could not safely execute user-defined rules. The architectural decision removes this blocker and provides a clear implementation path.

## Key Learnings

### What Worked Well
1. **Specialized Agents:** Each agent brought domain expertise (product, architecture, security)
2. **Iterative Clarification:** Questions → Answers → Confidence Check → More Questions
3. **Concrete Examples:** Code snippets and schemas eliminated ambiguity
4. **Critical Path Focus:** Prioritized P0 security blocker (PRD-005) first

### What Could Improve
1. **Batch Grooming:** Could groom multiple similar PRDs simultaneously
2. **Template Reuse:** Common patterns (API design, storage schema) could be templated
3. **Acceptance Criteria:** Some PRDs lacked clear pass/fail criteria initially

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Immediate (This Week):**
   - Implement PRD-007 (4 hours - quick win)
   - Start PRD-005 Phase 1 (2 weeks - critical security)

2. **Short Term (2-4 Weeks):**
   - Groom remaining P0 PRDs (001, 003, 004, 006, 008, 009)
   - Complete PRD-005 implementation
   - Begin PRD-014 implementation

3. **Medium Term (1-2 Months):**
   - Groom P1 PRDs (010, 011, 012, 013, 015, 017)
   - Complete P0 implementations
   - Begin P1 feature development

## Conclusion

The PRD grooming process successfully transformed 3 PRDs from "needs clarification" to "ready to implement" status (98% confidence). The most critical achievement was resolving PRD-005's architectural ambiguity, which was a major blocker for FLUO's security posture.

**Next Priority:** Continue grooming the remaining 12 PRDs, focusing on P0 production blockers first (PRD-001, 003, 004, 006, 008, 009).

**Estimated Time to Groom All PRDs:** 12 PRDs × 1.5 hours average = **~18 hours** of focused grooming work with specialized agents.
