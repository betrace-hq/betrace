    - **Evidence Needed**:
      - Customer authorization to use company names
      - Actual case studies or testimonials
      - Replace with real customer logos (with permission) or remove

## 🛠️ RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Immediate (Next 30 Days)
1. **Replace fictional company names** with "Customer testimonials coming soon" or remove section
2. **Add disclaimers** to all statistics: "Based on internal testing" or "Sample customer data"
3. **Qualify MTTR claims** with "in pilot testing with select customers"
4. **Document SLA terms** and link to actual service level agreement

### Short Term (30-90 Days)
1. **Conduct customer interviews** for testimonials and case studies
2. **Implement metrics tracking** for all claimed performance indicators
3. **Create controlled studies** comparing FLUO vs traditional monitoring
4. **Document technical benchmarks** with reproducible testing methodology

### Long Term (90+ Days)
1. **Publish case studies** with real customer data (anonymized if needed)
2. **Third-party validation** of uptime and performance claims
3. **Industry benchmarking** against established monitoring solutions
4. **Academic partnerships** for independent performance validation

## ⚖️ LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Advertising Standards Compliance
- **FTC Guidelines**: Claims must be substantiated with competent and reliable scientific evidence
- **Truthful Advertising**: All claims must be truthful and not misleading
- **Material Claims**: Performance claims (MTTR, uptime) are likely material to purchasing decisions

### Risk Mitigation
- Add qualifying language: "Based on pilot testing", "Early customer feedback", etc.
- Include disclaimers: "Results may vary", "Based on specific configurations"
- Avoid absolute claims without solid evidence

## 📊 EVIDENCE COLLECTION FRAMEWORK

### For Each Claim, Collect:
1. **Methodology**: How was the data collected?
2. **Sample Size**: How many customers/incidents/measurements?
3. **Time Period**: Over what duration was data collected?
4. **Controls**: What was the comparison baseline?
5. **Significance**: Is the result statistically meaningful?
6. **Reproducibility**: Can the results be consistently reproduced?

### Documentation Standards:
- Screenshots of actual metrics dashboards
- Customer testimonials with attribution
- Technical benchmark reports
- Statistical analysis of performance data
- Peer review of methodology

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

Landing page credibility will be achieved when:
- [ ] All performance claims have documented evidence
- [ ] Customer testimonials are from real, attributed sources
- [ ] Technical benchmarks are independently verifiable
- [ ] Legal team has approved all claims
- [ ] Industry analysts can validate key metrics
