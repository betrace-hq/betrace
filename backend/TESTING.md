# FLUO Backend Testing Guide

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests (WARNING: includes slow stress tests!)
mvn test

# Run tests with beautiful real-time monitoring
./watch-tests.sh

# Check test status (quick snapshot)
./test-status.sh

# Monitor a specific test run log
./watch-tests.sh /tmp/fluo-test-output.log
```

## Test Monitoring Tools

### `watch-tests.sh` - Real-Time Test Monitor (Recommended)

Beautiful TUI with `gum` that updates every 2 seconds. Shows:
- Currently running test suites
- Completed tests with pass/fail status
- Live summary (passing/failing counts)
- Automatic detection of build status

**Usage:**
```bash
# Monitor surefire reports directory (default)
./watch-tests.sh

# Monitor a specific log file
./watch-tests.sh /tmp/my-test-run.log

# Watch tests while running in another terminal
Terminal 1: mvn test 2>&1 | tee /tmp/test-run.log
Terminal 2: ./watch-tests.sh /tmp/test-run.log
```

### `test-status.sh` - Quick Status Check

One-time snapshot of current test status. Useful for CI or quick checks.

```bash
./test-status.sh                    # Check surefire reports
./test-status.sh /tmp/test-run.log  # Check specific log
```

## Test Categories

### Fast Tests (< 10 seconds)
Unit tests, integration tests - safe to run frequently:
```bash
mvn test -Dtest='!*Stress*,!*Bench*,!*Concurrency*'
```

### Concurrency Tests (10-30 seconds)
Thread safety and concurrent access tests:
```bash
mvn test -Dtest='*Concurrency*'
```

### Stress Tests (30+ seconds, resource intensive)
**WARNING: These create heavy load and resource exhaustion**
```bash
mvn test -Dtest='*Stress*'
```

### Performance Benchmarks
```bash
mvn test -Dtest='*Bench*'
```

## Running Tests by Component

### Security Tests Only
```bash
mvn test -Dtest='TenantSecurityProcessorTest,DuckDBServiceTest'
```

### Rate Limiter Tests
```bash
mvn test -Dtest='RateLimiter*'
```

### DSL Parser Tests
```bash
mvn test -Dtest='*Dsl*'
```

## Test Output Locations

- **Surefire Reports**: `target/surefire-reports/`
- **JaCoCo Coverage**: `target/site/jacoco/index.html`
- **Test Logs**: Check `target/surefire-reports/*.txt`

## Known Issues

### Slow Tests

The following tests are intentionally slow and should NOT be in default CI:

1. **TraceStorageStressTest** (3-5 minutes)
   - Tests with 20 tenants Ã— 50 concurrent operations
   - Creates massive resource exhaustion
   - Should be run separately or in nightly builds

2. **RateLimiterConcurrencyTest.testRateLimitAccuracyUnderLoad** (5+ seconds)
   - Tests rate limiter under sustained concurrent load
   - 3 tests currently fail due to test design (expecting depleted initial capacity)

### Test Design Issues

**Rate Limiter Test Failures** (3 tests):
- `testRateLimitAccuracyUnderLoad`
- `testBurstThenSustainedLoad`
- `testRateLimitRecovery`

**Issue**: Tests assume rate limiter starts with depleted capacity, but token bucket correctly starts with FULL capacity (1000 tokens).

**Status**: Test bug, NOT code bug. Tests need refactoring.

## CI Recommendations

```bash
# Fast CI pipeline (< 1 minute)
mvn test -Dtest='!*Stress*,!*Bench*' -DfailIfNoTests=false

# Nightly build (includes stress tests)
mvn test

# Coverage report
mvn jacoco:report
open target/site/jacoco/index.html
```

## Debugging Failed Tests

### View detailed failure output
```bash
cat target/surefire-reports/<TestClass>.txt
```

### Run single test with debug logging
```bash
mvn test -Dtest=MyTest -X
```

### Run test with Quarkus dev mode
```bash
mvn quarkus:test
```

## Test Coverage Requirements

- **Overall Instruction Coverage**: 90% minimum
- **Overall Branch Coverage**: 80% minimum
- **Critical Components** (Security, DuckDB, Rate Limiter): 95% minimum

Check coverage:
```bash
mvn jacoco:report
open target/site/jacoco/index.html
```

## Dependencies

- **gum**: For beautiful TUI monitoring (optional)
  ```bash
  # Install with Nix
  nix-shell -p gum

  # Or use fallback mode (scripts work without gum)
  ```

## Examples

### Watch tests while developing
```bash
# Terminal 1: Run tests in watch mode
mvn quarkus:test

# Terminal 2: Monitor progress
./watch-tests.sh
```

### Run subset of tests with monitoring
```bash
# Terminal 1
mvn test -Dtest='Security*,DuckDB*' 2>&1 | tee /tmp/security-tests.log

# Terminal 2
./watch-tests.sh /tmp/security-tests.log
```

### Quick health check before committing
```bash
./test-status.sh || echo "Tests failing - check output"
```
