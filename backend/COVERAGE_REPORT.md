## Recommendations

### Immediate Priority (0% coverage)
1. **Routes Package**: Add tests for all REST endpoints
2. **Security Package**: Critical - add security tests
3. **Components Package**: Add unit tests for business logic

### Good Coverage
- Model classes have good coverage (54%)
- Transformer classes are well tested (50-61%)

## How to Run Coverage

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
mvn clean test

# Generate detailed HTML report
mvn jacoco:report

# View HTML report
open target/site/jacoco/index.html
```

## Coverage Goals

- **Target**: 80% overall coverage
- **Current**: 25% overall coverage
- **Gap**: 55% additional coverage needed

## Next Steps

1. Add unit tests for Routes (API endpoints)
2. Add security tests for authentication/authorization
3. Add component tests for business logic
4. Increase branch coverage (currently only 13%)
