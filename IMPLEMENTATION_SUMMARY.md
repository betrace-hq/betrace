## 🎯 Strategic Positioning Validated

**Market Validation**: International AI Safety Report (96 experts, 30+ countries)

**Key Quote**:
> "Hardware-enabled mechanisms could help customers and regulators to monitor general-purpose AI systems more effectively during deployment...but **reliable mechanisms of this kind do not yet exist**."

**BeTrace's Response**: We ARE those mechanisms.

**Category Created**: "Behavioral Assurance for AI Systems"

**Competitive Position**: Complementary (not competitive) to existing approaches:
- Not replacing pre-deployment testing (we monitor production)
- Not replacing interpretability (we observe behavior)
- Not replacing training (we detect when it fails)

**Target Buyers**:
1. AI Safety Institutes (UK, EU, US)
2. AI Developers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind)
3. Enterprise AI Adopters (Healthcare, Finance, Legal)
4. Regulators & Policymakers

**Value Proposition**:
- Testing fails → BeTrace monitors production
- AI inscrutable → BeTrace observes behavior
- No metrics → BeTrace provides quantitative evidence
- Mechanisms don't exist → BeTrace exists
