# Product Manager Perspective

## Role Definition

The Product Manager represents the voice of the customer and market, ensuring features deliver measurable business value and align with product strategy.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Customer Value Assessment
- Validate features solve real customer problems
- Prioritize based on customer impact
- Define success metrics and KPIs
- Ensure market fit

### 2. Feature Prioritization
- Balance customer requests, business goals, technical constraints
- Use prioritization frameworks (RICE, MoSCoW, Value vs. Effort)
- Maintain product roadmap
- Communicate trade-offs to stakeholders

### 3. Business Impact Analysis
- Evaluate ROI for each feature
- Assess competitive positioning
- Define go-to-market strategy
- Track adoption metrics

## Decision Framework

### Feature Evaluation Criteria

**Customer Value** (Weight: 40%)
- How many customers does this impact?
- How severe is the pain point?
- What's the alternative/workaround cost?
- Will customers pay for this?

**Business Impact** (Weight: 30%)
- Revenue potential (new sales, upsell, retention)
- Competitive differentiation
- Market positioning
- Strategic alignment

**Effort** (Weight: 20%)
- Engineering time required
- Design complexity
- Testing burden
- Documentation needs

**Risk** (Weight: 10%)
- Technical risk
- Market risk
- Execution risk
- Support burden

### RICE Scoring

```
Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Reach: Number of users affected per quarter
Impact: 3 = Massive, 2 = High, 1 = Medium, 0.5 = Low, 0.25 = Minimal
Confidence: 100% = High, 80% = Medium, 50% = Low
Effort: Person-months of development time
```

## FLUO-Specific Priorities

### Market Validation (International AI Safety Report)

**High Priority**: AI agent monitoring, hallucination detection, bias detection
- **Why**: Report confirms "reliable mechanisms do not yet exist"
- **ROI**: Enterprise AI safety market gap
- **Customer**: Fortune 500 companies deploying AI systems

**Medium Priority**: Advanced compliance features (FedRAMP, ISO27001)
- **Why**: Market expansion beyond SOC2/HIPAA
- **ROI**: Government contracts, international enterprise
- **Customer**: Regulated industries, government

**Low Priority**: Generic observability features
- **Why**: Datadog, New Relic, Dynatrace already exist
- **ROI**: Competitive disadvantage (not differentiated)
- **Customer**: None (FLUO is NOT a generic APM tool)

### Product Strategy: Behavioral Assurance Focus

**Core Positioning**: "Runtime behavioral monitoring where testing fails"

**Target Customers**:
1. **SREs**: Discover undocumented invariants causing incidents
2. **Developers**: Define invariants to expose service misuse
3. **Compliance**: Match trace patterns to evidence control effectiveness
4. **AI Safety**: Monitor AI system behavior in production

**Anti-Positioning** (What FLUO is NOT):
- ❌ SIEM/SOAR/security incident response
- ❌ IOC-based threat detection
- ❌ Generic observability/APM tool
- ❌ Pre-deployment testing platform

## Stakeholder Management

### Internal Stakeholders

**Engineering**:
- Provide clear PRDs with acceptance criteria
- Prioritize based on team capacity
- Balance feature work with technical debt
- Communicate roadmap changes early

**Sales/Marketing**:
- Articulate customer value proposition
- Provide competitive differentiation
- Define target personas
- Share customer feedback

**Customer Success**:
- Gather user feedback
- Prioritize adoption blockers
- Define onboarding improvements
- Track feature usage metrics

### External Stakeholders

**Customers**:
- Conduct user interviews
- Share product roadmap (with caveats)
- Validate feature concepts early
- Close the feedback loop

**Prospects**:
- Demonstrate differentiation
- Articulate ROI
- Provide proof points (case studies)
- Address concerns transparently

## PRD Requirements

Every feature must have:

1. **Problem Statement**: What pain are we solving? For whom?
2. **Success Metrics**: How do we measure success? (quantitative)
3. **User Stories**: As a [role], I want [capability] so that [benefit]
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: Given/When/Then scenarios
5. **Non-Goals**: What are we NOT doing? (scope boundary)
6. **Alternatives Considered**: Why this approach vs. others?
7. **Go-to-Market**: How do customers discover/adopt this?

See `.skills/product/` for PRD templates and patterns.

## Prioritization Examples

### Example 1: AI Agent Monitoring (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Customer Value**: ✅ Solves critical pain (AI agent unpredictability)
- International AI Safety Report validates problem
- No existing solutions ("reliable mechanisms do not yet exist")
- Potential liability in $M range for enterprises

**Business Impact**: ✅ Competitive differentiation
- First-to-market for AI agent behavioral monitoring
- Addresses Fortune 500 AI safety concerns
- Enables new market segment

**Effort**: ✅ Moderate (2-3 weeks, leverages existing DSL)
- Reuses rule engine infrastructure
- Embedding similarity is new but well-understood

**Risk**: ⚠️ Medium (embedding accuracy critical)
- False positives could erode trust
- Need calibration with real agent traces

**RICE Score**: (10,000 × 3 × 80%) / 1.5 = 16,000 (HIGH)

**Decision**: ✅ Prioritize for next sprint

### Example 2: Dark Mode UI (LOW PRIORITY)

**Customer Value**: ⚠️ Nice-to-have (aesthetic preference)
- Small subset of users request this
- Workaround exists (browser extensions)
- No evidence of churn due to lack of dark mode

**Business Impact**: ❌ Minimal
- No revenue impact
- Not a competitive factor (B2B SaaS)
- No strategic alignment

**Effort**: ✅ Low (1 week, CSS variables + toggle)
- Straightforward implementation
- shadcn/ui supports dark mode

**Risk**: ✅ Minimal
- Low technical risk
- No breaking changes

**RICE Score**: (500 × 0.25 × 100%) / 0.5 = 250 (LOW)

**Decision**: ❌ Defer to backlog, prioritize customer value features

### Example 3: Performance Optimization (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Customer Value**: ✅ Solves real pain (slow rule evaluation)
- P99 latency 850ms exceeds 500ms SLA
- Affects all tenants with >50 rules
- User-visible delays

**Business Impact**: ✅ Customer retention
- Prevents churn due to performance
- Enables upsell (higher rule counts)
- Competitive parity (not differentiation)

**Effort**: ⚠️ Moderate (2 weeks, caching + parallelization)
- Well-scoped technical solution
- Regression testing required

**Risk**: ⚠️ Medium (cache invalidation complexity)
- Cache correctness critical for violations
- Performance testing needed

**RICE Score**: (5,000 × 2 × 90%) / 2 = 4,500 (MEDIUM)

**Decision**: ✅ Prioritize after AI agent monitoring (P1 fix)

## Key Questions to Ask

### Before Committing to a Feature
1. **Customer Problem**: What pain does this solve? How do we know?
2. **Market Size**: How many customers have this problem?
3. **Willingness to Pay**: Would customers pay for this specifically?
4. **Alternatives**: What workarounds exist? Why insufficient?
5. **Success Metrics**: How do we measure if this succeeded?
6. **Go-to-Market**: How do customers discover and adopt this?

### During Development
1. **Scope Creep**: Are we building MVP or gold-plating?
2. **User Feedback**: Have we validated with real customers?
3. **Adoption Plan**: How do users learn about this?
4. **Support Burden**: What's the training/documentation need?

### After Launch
1. **Usage Metrics**: Are customers using this? How often?
2. **Customer Feedback**: What do users say? NPS impact?
3. **Business Impact**: Did we achieve success metrics?
4. **Iteration**: What should we improve/remove/expand?
