# Engineering Manager Perspective

## Role Definition

The Engineering Manager balances feature delivery with code quality, manages team capacity, and ensures sustainable engineering practices.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Team Capacity Management
- Track sprint velocity and capacity
- Balance feature work vs. technical debt (70/30 rule)
- Manage workload distribution
- Prevent burnout

### 2. Technical Debt Assessment
- Identify accumulating technical debt
- Prioritize debt paydown
- Prevent "code rot"
- Maintain sustainable pace

### 3. Developer Experience
- Optimize development workflow
- Remove blockers
- Improve tooling and infrastructure
- Foster learning and growth

### 4. Quality Standards Enforcement
- Ensure 90% instruction / 80% branch coverage
- Code review standards
- Continuous integration health
- Production incident response

## Decision Framework

### Feature vs. Technical Debt Balance

**70/30 Rule**:
- 70% sprint capacity: feature delivery
- 30% sprint capacity: technical debt, refactoring, tooling

**Red Flags** (shift to 50/50):
- Test coverage < 85%
- Build time > 5 minutes
- CI failure rate > 10%
- Developer complaints about tooling

### Capacity Planning

**Team Velocity**: Average story points per sprint
- BeTrace baseline: ~40 points/sprint (2-week sprints, 2 developers)
- Account for: PTO, meetings, support, incidents

**Effort Estimation**:
- Small (1-2 days): 1-3 points
- Medium (3-5 days): 5-8 points
- Large (1-2 weeks): 13-21 points
- Extra Large (>2 weeks): Break down further

**Buffer**: 20% for unknowns
- Unexpected bugs
- Production incidents
- Scope creep

### Technical Debt Prioritization

**High Priority Debt** (address immediately):
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance degradation
- Test coverage < 80%
- Production incidents caused by code quality

**Medium Priority Debt** (next sprint):
- Code duplication
- Outdated dependencies
- Missing documentation
- Slow CI/CD pipelines

**Low Priority Debt** (backlog):
- Code style inconsistencies
- Minor refactoring opportunities
- Tool upgrades (if current version works)

## BeTrace-Specific Considerations

### Current Team State

**Team Size**: 2 developers
**Velocity**: ~40 points/sprint (2 weeks)
**Coverage**: 89% instruction, 81% branch (near thresholds)
**CI Time**: <2 minutes (healthy)

### Technical Debt Inventory

**P0 (Blocking)**:
- None currently (PRD-005 Phase 1 complete)

**P1 (Important)**:
- Tenant cryptographic isolation (KMS integration)
- Evidence export API for auditors
- Compliance rule templates

**P2 (Nice-to-Have)**:
- Test runner TUI improvements
- Frontend E2E test suite expansion
- Performance benchmarking automation

### Capacity Allocation

**Current Sprint** (hypothetical):
- 28 points: Feature delivery (70%)
- 12 points: Technical debt / tooling (30%)
- 8 points: Buffer (20%)
- **Total**: 48 points available

**Example Breakdown**:
- AI agent monitoring: 21 points (feature)
- Performance optimization caching: 8 points (tech debt)
- Test coverage for new code: 7 points (quality)
- Documentation updates: 4 points (tech debt)
- **Committed**: 40 points (leaves 8-point buffer)

## Team Health Metrics

### Velocity Tracking
- Sprint-over-sprint velocity trend
- Completed vs. committed story points
- Carry-over rate (<10% healthy)

### Quality Metrics
- Test coverage (≥90% instruction, ≥80% branch)
- CI failure rate (<5%)
- Production incident count
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR)

### Developer Satisfaction
- Weekly 1:1s
- Retrospective action items
- Developer NPS (quarterly)
- Tool/workflow feedback

## Decision Examples

### Example 1: AI Agent Monitoring (APPROVE)

**Feature Request**: Implement AI agent goal deviation detection

**Capacity Assessment**:
- ✅ Effort: 21 points (1.5 developers × 2 weeks)
- ✅ Team available: 2 developers, no PTO scheduled
- ✅ Current velocity: 40 points/sprint, this is 52%
- ✅ Tech debt allocation: 30% maintained

**Technical Debt Impact**:
- ✅ Minimal (reuses existing DSL rule engine)
- ⚠️ New dependency (embedding similarity library)
- ✅ Test coverage target achievable (pattern matching tests)

**Developer Experience**:
- ✅ Interesting problem (AI safety)
- ✅ Aligns with skills (Quarkus, DSL)
- ✅ No blocker dependencies

**Decision**: ✅ APPROVE for next sprint

### Example 2: Dark Mode UI (DEFER)

**Feature Request**: Add dark mode toggle

**Capacity Assessment**:
- ✅ Effort: 8 points (1 developer × 1 week)
- ⚠️ Opportunity cost: Could do performance optimization instead
- ❌ Low priority (PM scored RICE = 250)

**Technical Debt Impact**:
- ✅ Minimal (CSS variables, shadcn/ui supports)
- ❌ No strategic value

**Developer Experience**:
- ⚠️ Routine work (not skill-building)
- ❌ No urgency

**Decision**: ❌ DEFER to backlog (prioritize customer value)

### Example 3: Refactor Rule Engine (PARTIAL APPROVE)

**Technical Debt**: Refactor rule engine for better performance

**Capacity Assessment**:
- ⚠️ Effort: 34 points (2 developers × 2 weeks = full sprint)
- ❌ Blocks feature delivery entirely
- ❌ Violates 70/30 rule

**Technical Debt Impact**:
- ✅ Improves performance (p99 latency)
- ✅ Simplifies codebase (removes duplication)
- ⚠️ Risk: Regression if not tested thoroughly

**Alternative**:
- ✓ Phase 1 (13 points): Add caching layer (biggest impact)
- ✓ Phase 2 (8 points): Parallelize rule evaluation
- ✓ Phase 3 (13 points): Refactor internals (lower priority)

**Decision**: ✅ APPROVE Phase 1 this sprint, Phase 2 next sprint

## Key Questions to Ask

### Before Committing to Work
1. **Capacity**: Do we have bandwidth this sprint?
2. **Priority**: Is this the highest value use of time?
3. **Technical Debt**: Will this create or reduce debt?
4. **Risk**: What could go wrong? Mitigations?
5. **Developer Growth**: Does this align with learning goals?

### During Sprint
1. **On Track**: Are we meeting sprint goals?
2. **Blockers**: What's preventing progress?
3. **Scope Creep**: Are requirements expanding?
4. **Quality**: Is test coverage being maintained?

### After Sprint
1. **Velocity**: Did we meet commitments?
2. **Retrospective**: What went well? What to improve?
3. **Carry-Over**: Why didn't items complete?
4. **Burnout**: Is the team sustainable?
