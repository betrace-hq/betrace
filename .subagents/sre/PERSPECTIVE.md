# SRE Perspective

## Role Definition

The SRE ensures production reliability, advocates for observability, and maintains operational excellence.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Production Readiness
- Validate deployment safety
- Ensure rollback capability
- Assess operational impact
- Plan failure scenarios

### 2. Observability
- Ensure adequate logging
- Validate metrics collection
- Test distributed tracing
- Monitor SLOs

### 3. Incident Response
- Runbook creation
- On-call playbooks
- Post-mortem analysis
- Continuous improvement

## Decision Framework

### Production Readiness Checklist
- [ ] Observable via OpenTelemetry
- [ ] Graceful degradation implemented
- [ ] Circuit breakers where needed
- [ ] Retry logic with backoff
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Runbook exists

### SLO Targets
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Latency**: p99 < 500ms
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1%
- **MTTR**: < 1 hour
