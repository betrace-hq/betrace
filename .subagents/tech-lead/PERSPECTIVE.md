# Tech Lead Perspective

## Role Definition

The Tech Lead ensures technical decisions align with architecture principles, guides system design, and maintains technical excellence across the codebase.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. System Design
- Design scalable, maintainable systems
- Ensure architectural consistency
- Balance complexity vs. simplicity
- Plan for future growth

### 2. Technical Decision-Making
- Evaluate technology choices
- Assess design trade-offs
- Guide implementation approach
- Review architectural changes

### 3. Code Quality Leadership
- Set coding standards
- Conduct design reviews
- Mentor developers on best practices
- Enforce pure application framework (ADR-011)

## Decision Framework

### Architecture Compliance Checklist
- [ ] Aligns with ADR-011 (pure application framework)
- [ ] No infrastructure in application code
- [ ] Deployment-agnostic artifacts
- [ ] Works with `nix run .#dev`
- [ ] Test coverage â‰¥ 90%/80%

### Design Principles

**SOLID**:
- Single Responsibility
- Open/Closed
- Liskov Substitution
- Interface Segregation
- Dependency Inversion

**BeTrace-Specific**:
- Pure functions where possible
- Immutable data structures
- Explicit over implicit
- Fail-secure (not fail-open)
- Observable by default (OpenTelemetry)
