## Message Template 1: General (For Most Contributors)

### Subject Line
```
Your work on the International AI Safety Report
```

### Message Body (Keep under 300 characters for higher response rate)

**Version A (Concise)**:
```
Hi [First Name],

Saw your work on the International AI Safety Report — particularly
the section on [specific topic they contributed to].

We're building the behavioral assurance layer from Section 3.4.2
("reliable mechanisms...do not yet exist").

Would love your feedback on what we're building. Open to a brief call?

Best,
[Your name]
```

**Version B (Value-focused)**:
```
Hi [First Name],

Your contributions to the International AI Safety Report were excellent —
especially [specific insight].

We're building the AI monitoring infrastructure the report calls for
(Section 3.4.2). I'd love to share what we're doing and get your feedback.

Also happy to explore research partnerships if you're working in this area.

Would you have 15 minutes in the next few weeks?

Best,
[Your name]
```

**Version C (Research partnership focus)**:
```
Hi [First Name],

I saw your excellent work on the International AI Safety Report. The
section on [topic] was particularly insightful.

We're building the behavioral assurance layer described in 3.4.2 —
monitoring mechanisms that "do not yet exist."

Quick question: Would production AI trace data be useful for your
research? We provide real-world observability data that spot checks miss.

Happy to discuss collaboration if it's relevant.

Best,
[Your name]
```

## Message Template 2: For AI Agent Researchers

### Subject Line
```
Re: AI Agent Risk Management (Section 3.2.1)
```

### Message Body
```
Hi [First Name],

Your insights on AI agent risks in the International AI Safety Report
resonated strongly. The observation that "testing is insufficient for
agents" is critical.

We're building runtime behavioral monitoring for AI agents — exactly
what Section 3.2.1 describes as needed but "only beginning to be developed."

Specific capabilities:
- Goal deviation detection
- Prompt injection monitoring
- Multi-step operation tracking

Would you be interested in seeing a demo? Also open to research
collaboration if you're working in this space.

Best,
[Your name]
```

## Message Template 3: For Evaluation/Testing Researchers

### Subject Line
```
Re: Evaluation Gap (Section 3.2.1.E)
```

### Message Body
```
Hi [First Name],

The report's discussion of evaluation limitations was spot-on —
"spot checks miss hazards" because "test conditions differ from real world."

We're addressing this with continuous production monitoring via
OpenTelemetry traces. Not replacing pre-deployment testing, but
filling the gap for real-world behavior.

I'd love to share what we're building and get your feedback. Would
you have 15 minutes for a brief call?

Best,
[Your name]
```

## Message Template 4: For Industry Contributors (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

### Subject Line
```
Re: Evidence of Safety Frameworks (Section 3.2.2)
```

### Message Body
```
Hi [First Name],

Congratulations on [Company]'s contributions to the International AI
Safety Report. The section on evidence-based safety frameworks is
particularly important as regulations emerge.

We're building compliance evidence generation through behavioral
assurance — trace-based verification that AI systems follow expected
patterns in production.

Given [Company]'s leadership in AI safety, I'd love to share what
we're building. Would you be open to a brief conversation?

Best,
[Your name]
```

## Message Template 5: For Bias/Fairness Researchers

### Subject Line
```
Re: Subtle Forms of Bias (Section 2.2.2)
```

### Message Body
```
Hi [First Name],

Your work on bias detection in the International AI Safety Report was
excellent. The observation that "new evidence...reveals more subtle
forms of bias" is critical.

We're building statistical distribution analysis for AI outputs —
detecting bias patterns invisible during pre-deployment testing.

Example: Approval rate anomalies by demographic group across
thousands of production decisions.

Would you be interested in seeing the approach? Also happy to discuss
research collaboration if relevant.

Best,
[Your name]
```

## Follow-Up Message (If No Response After 2 Weeks)

### Subject Line
```
Re: Your work on the International AI Safety Report
```

### Message Body
```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my message from a couple weeks ago about BeTrace's
approach to the monitoring gap from Section 3.4.2.

Quick question: Is production AI behavioral monitoring something
you're actively researching?

If so, I'd love to share what we're building. If not, no worries —
happy to reconnect when it's relevant.

Best,
[Your name]
```

## Connection Request Message (If Not Yet Connected)

**Keep it SHORT for connection requests (<200 characters)**:

```
Hi [First Name], saw your work on the International AI Safety Report.
We're building the monitoring infrastructure from 3.4.2. Would love
to connect!
```

---

## Response Handling

### If They Say "Tell me more"
```
Great! Here's a quick overview:

The report identified that "reliable mechanisms for monitoring AI systems
during deployment do not yet exist" (Section 3.4.2).

BeTrace provides behavioral assurance through OpenTelemetry trace monitoring.
Three main capabilities:

1. AI agent runtime monitoring (addresses Section 3.2.1)
2. Hallucination detection in production (addresses 2.2.1)
3. Bias detection via statistical analysis (addresses 2.2.2)

Would you prefer:
- 20-minute demo call
- Written technical deep-dive
- Research collaboration discussion

What works best for you?
```

### If They Say "Not relevant to my work"
```
No problem! Thanks for the quick response.

If you know anyone working on AI deployment monitoring or production
safety, I'd appreciate an intro. Otherwise, happy to stay in touch
for future.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### If They Say "Interested in research partnership"
```
Excellent! A few ways we could collaborate:

1. Production trace data access (real-world AI behavior, not lab conditions)
2. Evaluation methodology validation (test our patterns vs. your benchmarks)
3. Co-author papers on behavioral assurance approaches

Does one of these sound most interesting? Happy to schedule a call to
discuss details.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### If They Offer Intro to Enterprise Buyer
```
That would be amazing, thank you!

A few context points for the intro:
- BeTrace provides behavioral assurance for AI systems
- Addresses gaps from International AI Safety Report
- Focus: AI agents, hallucinations, bias in production

Would you like me to draft an intro email you can forward? Or prefer
to intro directly?

Really appreciate it!

Best,
[Your name]
```

## Example: Fully Personalized Message

**Target**: Dr. Jane Smith, contributed to Section 3.2.1 (AI Agents), works at Stanford HAI

**Research Done**:
- Recent paper: "Evaluating AI Agent Reliability" (arXiv)
- Recent LinkedIn post about agent safety challenges
- Common connection: Prof. John Doe (mutual connection)

**Message**:
```
Hi Jane,

Your recent arXiv paper on agent reliability was excellent — the
section on test-time vs. deployment-time behavior differences
resonated strongly.

We're building runtime monitoring for AI agents (addressing the gaps
from Section 3.2.1 of the AI Safety Report). I'd love to get your
feedback on our approach.

Also noticed we both know Prof. Doe! Would you have 15 minutes for a
brief call in the next few weeks?

Best,
[Your name]
```

**Why This Works**:
- References her recent work (shows you did research)
- Connects to report (establishes relevance)
- Mentions common connection (builds trust)
- Specific, actionable ask (15-minute call)
- Respectful of time (brief, to the point)
