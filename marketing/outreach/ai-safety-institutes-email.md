### Version 1: Concise (Recommended)

```
Subject: Tools for the Early Warning Systems You Need

Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out regarding the International AI Safety Report's conclusion
that "reliable mechanisms for deployment monitoring do not yet exist"
(Section 3.4.2).

We built those mechanisms.

FLUO provides behavioral assurance for AI systems through OpenTelemetry
trace monitoring — exactly the "early warning system" the report calls for.

Specific capabilities addressing report gaps:

1. AI agent runtime monitoring (Section 3.2.1: testing is insufficient)
2. Production hallucination detection (Section 2.2.1: spot checks miss hazards)
3. Bias detection via statistical distribution analysis (Section 2.2.2: subtle forms emerging)

Would you be open to a 20-minute demo showing how FLUO addresses the
monitoring gaps identified in the report?

I'm also happy to explore research partnerships — we provide production
trace data for AI safety research.

Best regards,

### Version 2: Detailed (For Technical Audiences)

```
Subject: Re: "Reliable mechanisms do not yet exist" (AI Safety Report Section 3.4.2)

Dear [Name],

The International AI Safety Report identified a critical gap:

> "Hardware-enabled mechanisms could help customers and regulators to
> monitor general-purpose AI systems more effectively during deployment
> and potentially help verify agreements across borders, but reliable
> mechanisms of this kind do not yet exist."

FLUO is that mechanism.

**What FLUO Provides:**

1. **AI Agent Monitoring** (Report Section 3.2.1)
   - Problem: "Testing is insufficient for agents"
   - Solution: Runtime behavioral monitoring via trace patterns
   - Example: Goal deviation detection, prompt injection detection

2. **Hallucination Detection** (Report Section 2.2.1)
   - Problem: "Spot checks miss hazards, test conditions differ from real world"
   - Solution: Production pattern matching for reliability violations
   - Example: Medical diagnoses without citations, low-confidence claims

3. **Bias Detection** (Report Section 2.2.2)
   - Problem: "New evidence...reveals more subtle forms of bias"
   - Solution: Statistical distribution analysis of AI outputs
   - Example: Hiring decision distributions, loan approval anomalies

**Technical Approach:**
- OpenTelemetry trace instrumentation (industry standard)
- Pattern-based behavioral verification (not black-box interpretability)
- Continuous evaluation (not one-time spot checks)
- Quantitative metrics (pattern match rates, violation counts)

**Why This Matters:**
The report explicitly states current approaches have "highly significant
limitations." FLUO provides the missing layer between pre-deployment testing
and post-incident forensics.

**Next Steps:**
I'd love to share a demo showing FLUO addressing the specific gaps from
Sections 3.2.1, 3.4.2, and others. Would you have 20 minutes in the next
two weeks?

Also open to discussing:
- Research partnerships (production trace data access)
- Evaluation framework collaboration
- Early access for your testing/validation

### Version 3: Research Partnership Focus

```
Subject: Research Partnership: Production AI Trace Data for Safety Research

Dear [Name],

I saw your contributions to the International AI Safety Report — particularly
[specific section they contributed to] which was very insightful.

We're building the behavioral assurance layer described in Section 3.4.2
("reliable mechanisms...do not yet exist"). I'd love to explore a research
partnership.

**What We Offer:**
- Production trace data from AI systems (real-world, not lab conditions)
- Access to behavioral pattern detection infrastructure
- Collaboration on evaluation methodologies

**What We've Built:**
- AI agent runtime monitoring (addresses Section 3.2.1 testing limitations)
- Hallucination detection in production (addresses Section 2.2.1 evaluation gap)
- Bias detection via statistical analysis (addresses Section 2.2.2)

**Research Opportunities:**
1. Evaluation methodology validation (Section 3.2.1.E)
2. Early warning system effectiveness (Section 3.2.2)
3. Quantitative risk metrics development (Section 3.3)

The report identified that "spot checks miss hazards" — we provide continuous
production monitoring that could validate (or challenge) lab-based evaluations.

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss potential collaboration?

## Follow-Up Template (If No Response After 1 Week)

```
Subject: Re: Tools for the Early Warning Systems You Need

Hi [Name],

Following up on my email from last week about FLUO's approach to the
AI monitoring gap identified in Section 3.4.2 of the International AI
Safety Report.

Quick question: Is continuous AI behavioral monitoring something your
institute is actively exploring?

If so, I'd love to share what we're building. If not, no worries —
happy to reconnect when it becomes a priority.

Best,
[Your name]
