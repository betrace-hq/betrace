**Stop Fighting Alert Fatigue: Pattern-Based Detection for SREs**

It's 3 AM. Your pager just went off because your system is experiencing an unexpected surge in requests, causing a downstream database to become overwhelmed. You rush to the monitoring dashboard and see a flurry of alerts indicating high latency, error rates, and resource utilization. The noise is deafening.

But which ones are real problems? And how many times have you dealt with false positives from metric thresholds that were set too aggressively?

As a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE), you're tasked with ensuring the reliability and performance of complex systems. But traditional monitoring tools often fall short in detecting nuanced behavioral patterns, leading to:

1. **Incidents caused by undocumented invariants**: Hidden assumptions about system behavior lead to unexpected failures.
2. **Alert fatigue from metric thresholds**: Overly sensitive metrics trigger too many false positives.
3. **Inability to detect complex behavioral patterns**: Systems exhibit intricate interactions that traditional monitoring tools can't capture.

**The Traditional Approach Falls Short**

APM (Application Performance Monitoring) and log analysis tools provide visibility into symptoms, but not the underlying patterns driving them. They're like trying to diagnose a car problem by looking at the dashboard gauges instead of the engine itself.

### The Problem with Metric Thresholds

Setting thresholds for metrics is an art, not a science. Overly aggressive thresholds generate too many false positives, while conservative ones might miss real issues. And what about nuanced situations where multiple factors interact? Traditional tools can't keep up.

**How BeTrace Changes the Game**

Introducing BeTrace, the Behavioral Assurance System for OpenTelemetry Data. BeTrace brings a new approach to monitoring: **pattern-based detection**.

With BeTrace, you define behavioral invariants using our JavaScript-based DSL (Domain-Specific Language). When traces violate these patterns, you get signals â€“ not just when metrics cross lines.

Let's look at an example:

```javascript
// "We had an incident where payments were processed without fraud checks"
trace.has(payment.charge_card) and trace.has(payment.fraud_check)
```

This rule captures a critical invariant: that every payment should have both card charge and fraud check spans. When this pattern is violated, BeTrace generates a signal indicating the potential issue.

**Real-World Scenario**

Suppose you're responsible for an e-commerce platform with multiple services interacting with each other. You define rules to detect patterns like:

* Auth retry storms: `trace.spans.where(service == 'auth').count() > 50`
* High latency in payment processing: `trace.duration('payment') > 500ms`

When these patterns are violated, you receive signals indicating potential issues.

**Why This Matters**

BeTrace's pattern-based detection reduces noise and focuses on real problems. By catching complex behavioral patterns early, you:

1. **Reduce incidents caused by undocumented invariants**
2. **Decrease alert fatigue from metric thresholds**
3. **Improve post-incident analysis with automated signal extraction**

**Conclusion**

Don't let alert fatigue hold you back from delivering high-quality services. With BeTrace's pattern-based detection, you'll be empowered to:

* Reduce incidents caused by undocumented invariants
* Decrease alert noise from metric thresholds
* Improve post-incident analysis with automated signal extraction
