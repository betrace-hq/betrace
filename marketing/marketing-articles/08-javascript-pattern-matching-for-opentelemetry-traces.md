**JavaScript Pattern Matching for OpenTelemetry Traces**

As a developer, have you ever felt like you're fighting a losing battle against service misuse by other teams? Are unclear expectations about service behavior causing more problems than they solve? Do you struggle to enforce API contracts and maintain visibility into how services are actually used?

It's time to change the game with FLUO – the Behavioral Assurance System for OpenTelemetry Data. With FLUO, you can define behavioral contracts as patterns using JavaScript, detect API misuse in real-time, self-document your service invariants, and enjoy a developer-friendly DSL (Domain-Specific Language) for pattern definition.

**How Pattern Matching Works**

1. FLUO receives OpenTelemetry traces via OTLP protocol.
2. Rules are configured in FLUO's web UI (http://localhost:3000).
3. Rules use JavaScript-based DSL, not declarative syntax like most other systems.
4. When patterns match, FLUO generates "signals" – violations that require investigation.
5. Your SREs investigate signals to discover hidden invariants and optimize service behavior.

**The Power of JavaScript Pattern Matching**

FLUO's DSL is built on top of JavaScript, allowing you to define complex patterns with ease. With a few lines of code, you can:

* Check if a span contains a specific operation name: `trace.has(operation_name)`
* Filter spans by attribute conditions: `trace.has(operation_name).where(attribute comparison value)`
* Count spans matching a pattern: `trace.count(operation_pattern)`

Here's an example rule that detects too many retries:
```javascript
// Too many retries
trace.count(http.retry) > 3
```
And another that identifies request-response mismatches:
```javascript
// Request/response mismatch
trace.count(http.request) != trace.count(http.response)
```
**Real-World Scenario**

Let's say you're investigating a production issue where an authentication service is experiencing high retry rates. With FLUO, you can define a pattern like this:
```javascript
// Auth retry storm detection
trace.has(span => span.name === 'auth.login' && span.status === 'ERROR')
  .and(trace.has(span => span.name === 'auth.login' && span.status === 'OK'))
  .within('5 seconds')
```
When the rule matches, FLUO generates a signal that alerts your SREs to investigate further. They can then use this insight to optimize service behavior and prevent future issues.

**Why This Matters**

By using JavaScript pattern matching for OpenTelemetry traces, you can:

* Reduce mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to resolve (MTTR)
* Improve API contract enforcement and reduce downstream impacts
* Gain real-time visibility into service behavior and optimize performance

With FLUO, you're not just monitoring – you're actively managing your services' behavior to ensure they meet your expectations.

**Getting Started**

Ready to try FLUO? Start by defining some rules using the JavaScript DSL. Experiment with different patterns and see how FLUO helps you discover hidden invariants and optimize service behavior.

Remember, pattern matching is not just about detecting issues – it's about proactively managing your services' behavior to ensure they meet your expectations.
