## Email #2: Day 3 - Case Study + Implementation Guide

**Subject:** How [COMPANY] uses FLUO in production

**From:** FLUO Team <hello@fluohq.com>

**Body:**

```
Hi [FIRST_NAME],

You downloaded our whitepaper on [TOPIC]. Here's how teams are using FLUO in production:

**[CASE_STUDY_TITLE]**

[CUSTOMIZE PER WHITEPAPER - see templates below]

**Getting Started:**
The fastest way to see FLUO in action:

1. Start local dev: `nix run github:fluohq/fluo#dev`
2. Write your first invariant rule (5 minutes):
   ```javascript
   trace.has(database.query)
     and trace.has(query.execution_time).where(execution_time_ms > 5000)
   ```
3. Export your traces to FLUO (OpenTelemetry integration)

**Full Quickstart:** [LINK_TO_DOCS]

P.S. In 4 days we'll send you our DSL cheat sheet for common patterns.

### Per-Whitepaper Case Studies

**Economics of Observability:**
```
**Case Study: "From $400K Datadog Bill to $60K Tempo+FLUO"**

**Company:** TechCorp (B2B SaaS, 150 engineers)

**Challenge:**
- Datadog bill: $400K/year and growing 50%/year
- CFO demanded 50% cost reduction
- Engineering resisted: "We need 100% trace retention for debugging"

**Solution:**
- Migrated to Grafana Tempo ($40K/year for storage)
- Added FLUO for pattern matching ($20K/year maintenance)
- Kept Datadog for metrics only ($60K/year)

**Results:**
- 85% cost reduction ($400K → $60K)
- Faster incident investigations (rule replay vs. search)
- 100% trace coverage maintained
- Engineering team happier (better tooling, lower costs)

**Timeline:** 2 months migration

```

**Hidden Cost of Invariants:**
```
**Case Study: "14-Day Investigation → 30 Seconds with Rule Replay"**

**Company:** OmniCart (E-commerce platform)

**Challenge:**
- Black Friday incident: $2.4M revenue loss, 14-day investigation
- Invariant: "Premium users must skip queue" (tribal knowledge only)
- Hidden in 186M trace spans across 29 days

**Solution:**
- Formalized invariant as FLUO rule:
  ```javascript
  trace.has(queue.enqueued)
    and trace.has(user.premium).where(user.premium == true)
  ```
- Rule replay on historical traces
- Found 47 violations during Black Friday

**Results:**
- Next incident: 30 seconds to root cause (vs. 14 days)
- Prevented repeat incident in staging (found with rule replay)
- Saved $2.4M+ in future lost revenue

**Lesson:** Tribal knowledge isn't measurable. FLUO rules are.

**Multi-Tenant Security:**
```
**Case Study: "Proving Zero Tenant Leakage for SOC2 Audit"**

**Company:** MediPlatform (Healthcare SaaS, HIPAA compliance)

**Challenge:**
- SOC2 auditor asked: "Prove tenant isolation held for entire year"
- Sample-based testing: Only 25 operations audited
- Fear: Unknown isolation bugs could cause $20M+ breach

**Solution:**
- FLUO tenant boundary rule:
  ```javascript
  trace.has(database.query)
    and not trace.has(tenant.id).where(queried_tenant == authenticated_tenant)
  ```
- 100% of operations validated (not 25 samples)
- Historical replay on 12 months of production traces

**Results:**
- Zero violations found (proof of isolation)
- Auditor accepted FLUO compliance spans as evidence
- Passed SOC2 Type II
- Peace of mind for CISO

**Timeline:** 1 week setup, 12 months evidence collection

```

**Compliance Evidence Automation:**
```
**Case Study: "160 Hours → 10 Hours: SOC2 Audit Prep Automation"**

**Company:** CloudSecure (Security SaaS startup)

**Challenge:**
- First SOC2 audit approaching
- Manual evidence collection: Screenshots, log exports, CSV dumps
- Estimated effort: 160 hours (4 weeks full-time)

**Solution:**
- Annotated code with @SOC2 compliance framework:
  ```java
  @SOC2(controls = {CC6_1}, notes = "User authorization check")
  public boolean authorizeUser(String userId) { ... }
  ```
- FLUO auto-generated compliance spans
- Auditor queried spans directly: `{span.compliance.control = "CC6_1"}`

**Results:**
- Audit prep: 10 hours (not 160)
- 100% evidence coverage (not 25-sample audit)
- Passed SOC2 Type I on first attempt
- Compliance engineer 10x more productive

**Cost Savings:** $22,500 (150 hours × $150/hr fully-loaded)

## Email #3: Day 7 - DSL Cheat Sheet + Community

**Subject:** FLUO DSL Cheat Sheet: 10 Common Patterns

**From:** FLUO Team <hello@fluohq.com>

**Body:**

```
Hi [FIRST_NAME],

You've had a week to explore FLUO. Here are the 10 most common patterns our users start with:

**🔍 Performance Patterns**
```javascript
// Slow database queries
trace.has(database.query)
  and trace.has(query.execution_time).where(execution_time_ms > 5000)

// Retry storms (>3 retries)
trace.has(http.request)
  and trace.has(retry.count).where(retry.count > 3)
```

**🔒 Security Patterns**
```javascript
// Unauthorized database access
trace.has(database.query)
  and not trace.has(auth.check).where(auth.check.passed == true)

// PII access without audit log
trace.has(pii.accessed)
  and not trace.has(audit.log)
```

**✅ Compliance Patterns**
```javascript
// SOC2 CC6.1: Authorization before access
trace.has(data.access)
  and trace.has(auth.check).where(auth.check.timestamp < data.access.timestamp)

// HIPAA: PHI access requires audit
trace.has(phi.accessed)
  and trace.has(audit.log).where(audit.log.phi_access == true)
```

**🏢 Multi-Tenant Patterns**
```javascript
// Tenant isolation check
trace.has(database.query)
  and not trace.has(tenant.id).where(queried_tenant == authenticated_tenant)

// Cross-tenant API calls
trace.has(api.request)
  and trace.has(tenant.access_denied)
```

**⚡ Reliability Patterns**
```javascript
// Circuit breaker failures
trace.has(circuit_breaker.state).where(state == "open")
  and trace.has(downstream.service).where(service == "payment")

// Rate limit violations
trace.has(rate_limit.exceeded)
  and trace.has(user.tier).where(tier == "premium")
```
