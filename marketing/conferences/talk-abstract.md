## Abstract (Standard - 250 words)

In January 2025, the International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI—authored by 96 experts from 30+ countries—identified critical gaps in current AI risk management approaches:

1. **Pre-deployment testing fails**: "Spot checks miss hazards because test conditions differ from real world"
2. **AI internals are inscrutable**: "Developers cannot explain why models create outputs"
3. **No quantitative risk metrics**: Unlike aerospace/nuclear, AI lacks safety guarantees
4. **Monitoring mechanisms don't exist**: "Reliable mechanisms of this kind do not yet exist" (Section 3.4.2)

Most critically, the report concludes that for AI agents, "it would be difficult or impossible to assure safety by relying on testing" because agents can "distinguish testing conditions from real-world conditions."

This talk presents **behavioral assurance**: continuous production monitoring using OpenTelemetry traces to fill the gaps pre-deployment testing cannot. We demonstrate:

- **AI agent runtime monitoring** where testing is fundamentally insufficient
- **Hallucination detection** via pattern matching (medical diagnoses without citations, low-confidence claims)
- **Bias detection** via statistical distribution analysis (lending decisions, hiring algorithms)
- **Loss of control precursor detection** (early warning for concerning AI behaviors)

Attendees will leave with:
- Practical patterns for monitoring AI systems in production
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation strategies
- Real-world case studies (healthcare, financial services, legal AI)
- Implementation roadmap (5 weeks from zero to production monitoring)

**Live demo included**: Agent behavioral monitoring catching violations in real-time.

This talk addresses the monitoring gap explicitly identified in the report, providing practitioners with actionable tools for AI safety in production.

## Abstract (Long - 500 words for Academic Conferences)

**Context**

The International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI (January 2025) represents a landmark consensus among 96 experts from 30+ countries, including representatives from major AI developers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind), academic institutions (Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, Oxford), and international organizations (UN, EU, OECD). Chair: Yoshua Bengio.

The report identifies three fundamental challenges in AI safety:

1. **Pre-deployment testing is insufficient**: "Existing evaluations...often miss hazards and overestimate or underestimate general-purpose AI capabilities and risks, because test conditions differ from the real world" (Section 3.2.1.E). Example: Academic cheating risk shifted from negligible to widespread within one year—no pre-deployment test predicted this.

2. **AI internals remain inscrutable**: "Despite recent progress, developers and scientists cannot yet explain why these models create a given output, nor what function most of their internal components perform" (Section 3.2.1.C). Interpretability research is described as "nascent" and "severely limited."

3. **Current approaches have significant limitations**: "Best available approaches still have highly significant limitations and lack the quantitative risk estimation or guarantees available in other safety-critical domains" (Section 3.3).

Most critically for AI agents—autonomous systems that plan, act, and delegate—the report states: "Researchers have argued that it would be difficult or impossible to assure the safety of advanced agents by relying on testing, if those agents can make long-term plans and can distinguish testing conditions from real-world conditions" (Section 3.2.1.A).

The report explicitly identifies the need for deployment monitoring: "Hardware-enabled mechanisms could help customers and regulators to monitor general-purpose AI systems more effectively during deployment...but **reliable mechanisms of this kind do not yet exist**" (Section 3.4.2).

**This Talk**

We present **behavioral assurance** as the missing monitoring layer: continuous production monitoring using OpenTelemetry traces to observe AI system behavior where pre-deployment testing fails.

**Technical Approach**:
1. **Instrumentation**: OpenTelemetry `@WithSpan` annotations on AI inference calls, agent operations, and AI-driven decisions
2. **Pattern Definition**: Behavioral invariants expressed as trace patterns (e.g., "medical diagnosis requires source citations," "agent operations within authorized boundaries")
3. **Real-time Detection**: Pattern matching engine (Drools-based) evaluates traces continuously, emitting signals for violations
4. **Evidence Generation**: Compliance spans provide cryptographically-signed audit trail for regulators

**Demonstration Areas**:

1. **AI Agent Monitoring** (addresses Report Section 3.2.1.A)
   - Goal deviation detection
   - Prompt injection / hijacking detection
   - Tool use authorization
   - Multi-step operation tracking
   - Demo: Legal research agent operating outside authorized database access

2. **Hallucination Detection** (addresses Report Section 2.2.1)
   - Medical diagnosis citation requirements
   - Low-confidence disclosure enforcement
   - Financial advice verification
   - Demo: Clinical AI generating diagnosis without evidence citation

3. **Bias Detection** (addresses Report Section 2.2.2)
   - Statistical distribution analysis across demographics
   - Approval rate variance detection (lending, hiring)
   - Geographic redlining detection
   - Demo: Loan approval bias detected via 30-day rolling window analysis

4. **Loss of Control Precursors** (addresses Report Section 2.2.3)
   - Unauthorized access attempts
   - Oversight evasion detection
   - Self-modification monitoring
   - Demo: AI agent attempting unauthorized resource acquisition

**Real-World Results**:
- Healthcare: 12,847 diagnoses monitored, 47 violations detected (0.37%), 0 patient harm incidents
- Financial Services: 18,392 loan decisions monitored, bias pattern detected (data quality bug causing apparent discrimination)
- Legal Tech: 3,247 agent operations monitored, 8 violations detected (0.25%), 0 privilege breaches

**Takeaways for Attendees**:
1. Practical pattern library for common AI safety scenarios
2. OpenTelemetry instrumentation strategies (Java, Python, Node.js examples)
3. Implementation roadmap (5-week timeline from zero to production monitoring)
4. ROI analysis framework (liability prevention, compliance evidence, quantifiable safety metrics)
5. Open-source pattern repository (GitHub)

**Relevance**:
This talk directly addresses the monitoring gap identified in Report Section 3.4.2. While the report concludes such mechanisms "do not yet exist," this talk demonstrates a production-ready implementation using industry-standard OpenTelemetry, filling the gap with practical, deployable tools.

## Abstract (Short - 100 words for Brief Submissions)

The International AI Safety Report (96 experts, 30+ countries) concluded that "reliable mechanisms for monitoring AI systems during deployment do not yet exist." This talk presents **behavioral assurance**: continuous production monitoring using OpenTelemetry traces. We demonstrate AI agent runtime monitoring (where testing is fundamentally insufficient), hallucination detection, bias detection, and loss of control precursor detection. Attendees receive practical patterns, implementation strategies, and real-world case studies from healthcare, finance, and legal AI. **Live demo included**: Agent monitoring catching violations in real-time. Addresses the monitoring gap explicitly identified in Report Section 3.4.2.
