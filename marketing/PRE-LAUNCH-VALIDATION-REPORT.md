**Critical Issues:**
1. Chaos Engineering whitepaper describes automated workflows (not implemented)
2. Code examples need validation (56 JavaScript blocks found)
3. Missing infrastructure (landing page, email capture)

**Safe to Publish After Fixes:**
- Economics of Observability (minor edits needed)
- Hidden Cost of Invariants (ready)
- Multi-Tenant Security (ready)
- Compliance Evidence Automation (ready with disclaimers)

---

## Audit Results by Whitepaper

### 1. Economics of Observability (26KB)

**Compliance Claims:** ✅ PASS
- No "SOC2 certified" or "HIPAA compliant" claims found
- Uses correct language: "compliance-ready"

**Deployment Claims:** ✅ PASS
- No "production platform" or "Kubernetes deployment" claims
- Correctly describes FLUO as application framework

**Code Examples:** ⚠️ NEEDS VALIDATION
- JavaScript code blocks found
- Need to verify DSL syntax matches FluoDslParser.g4

**Verdict:** ✅ **READY** after code example validation

---

### 2. Hidden Cost of Undocumented Invariants (32KB)

**Compliance Claims:** ✅ PASS
- No certification claims

**Deployment Claims:** ✅ PASS
- Describes pattern matching, not deployment

**Code Examples:** ⚠️ NEEDS VALIDATION
- Multiple DSL examples (OmniCart case study)
- Must verify syntax

**Verdict:** ✅ **READY** after code example validation

---

### 3. Multi-Tenant Security Architecture (34KB)

**Compliance Claims:** ✅ PASS
- Correctly describes "compliance-ready" not "certified"

**Deployment Claims:** ✅ PASS
- No platform claims

**Code Examples:** ⚠️ NEEDS VALIDATION
- DSL examples for tenant isolation

**Security Claims:** ⚠️ MINOR CONCERN
- References PRD-005 sandboxing (9.5/10 security rating)
- Should add disclaimer: "Security audit recommended for production use"

**Verdict:** ✅ **READY** with disclaimer after code validation

---

### 4. Compliance Evidence Automation (38KB)

**Compliance Claims:** ⚠️ NEEDS CLARIFICATION
- Describes compliance evidence generation (✅ accurate)
- References "certification timeline" (⚠️ could be misleading)

**Code Examples:** ⚠️ NEEDS VALIDATION
- @SOC2/@HIPAA annotation examples
- TraceQL queries

**Verdict:** ✅ **READY** with disclaimer:
```markdown
**IMPORTANT:** FLUO generates compliance evidence but is NOT certified
for SOC2, HIPAA, or any compliance framework. External audit required
for certification. See: docs/compliance-status.md
```

---

### 5. Chaos Engineering Integration (41KB)

**Automation Claims:** ❌ **BLOCKING ISSUE**

**Lines 738-1020: Describes Automated Chaos Workflows**
- Line 740: "Weekly automated chaos experiments with behavioral validation"
- Line 1020: "Expand to weekly automated chaos tests"
- Line 1107: "Weekly automated chaos experiments with FLUO validation"

**Problem:** FLUO does NOT automate chaos experiments. It validates behavior during manual chaos tests.

**Required Changes:**
1. Remove "Continuous Chaos (Automated)" section (lines 738-850)
2. Reframe: "Manual chaos testing with FLUO behavioral validation"
3. Update case study: Black Friday test was MANUAL, not automated

**Verdict:** ❌ **DO NOT PUBLISH** until rewritten

**Alternative:** Archive to speculative/ until automation features ship

---

## Code Example Validation

### Methodology

Extract all DSL code examples and verify against FLUO syntax:

**FLUO DSL Correct Syntax:**
```javascript
trace.has(span_name)
  and trace.has(attribute).where(condition)
```

**NOT Drools Syntax:**
```javascript
rule "Name" when ... then ... end  // WRONG
```

### Validation Script

```bash
# Extract JavaScript code blocks
grep -Pzo '```javascript\n(.*?\n)*?```' *.md > /tmp/code-examples.txt

# Count examples
wc -l /tmp/code-examples.txt
# Result: 56 JavaScript code blocks

# Manual review required for each block
# TODO: Automate with FluoDslParser.g4 grammar
```

### Sample Validation (Economics of Observability)

**Example 1:** (Needs verification)
```javascript
trace.has(database.query)
  and trace.has(query.execution_time).where(execution_time_ms > 5000)
```

**Status:** ✅ Syntax appears correct (trace.has + where clause)

**Example 2:** (Needs verification)
```javascript
trace.has(auth.check)
  and not trace.has(auth.success).where(auth.success == true)
```

**Status:** ✅ Syntax appears correct

**Recommendation:** Full validation required for all 56 blocks

---

## Deployment Platform Claims

### Search Results

```bash
grep -n "production.ready\|production.platform\|enterprise.platform" *.md
# Result: No matches found
```

**Verdict:** ✅ **PASS** - No deployment platform overclaims

---

## Compliance Certification Claims

### Search Results

```bash
grep -ni "fluo.*certified\|fluo.*compliant" *.md
# Result: No direct claims found
```

**Indirect References:**
- compliance-evidence-automation.md mentions "certification timeline"
- Should clarify: FLUO provides evidence, NOT certification

**Verdict:** ✅ **PASS** with disclaimer recommendation

---

## Missing Infrastructure

### Critical Gaps (Blocking Launch)

1. **No Landing Page**
   - Whitepapers reference fluohq.com (doesn't exist)
   - Need: Hero, value prop, email capture, whitepaper downloads

2. **No Email Capture**
   - Can't generate leads from whitepapers
   - Need: ConvertKit/Mailchimp integration

3. **No GitHub README Update**
   - Current README doesn't reflect marketing messaging
   - Need: Launch announcement, whitepaper links, compliance disclaimer

4. **No Email Nurture Sequence**
   - User downloads whitepaper... then what?
   - Need: 3-email sequence (Day 0, Day 3, Day 7)

---

## Recommended Fixes

### Priority 1: BLOCKING (Must Fix Before Launch)

#### Fix 1: Archive Chaos Engineering Whitepaper
```bash
mv chaos-to-confidence.md ../archive/speculative/chaos-to-confidence-v1.md
echo "Archived until automation features ship" >> ../archive/speculative/README.md
```

**Alternative:** Rewrite to focus on manual chaos validation (8-12 hours)

#### Fix 2: Add Compliance Disclaimer to All Whitepapers
Add to frontmatter of each whitepaper:

```markdown
---
**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**
FLUO generates compliance evidence but is NOT certified for SOC2, HIPAA,
or any compliance framework. External audit required for certification.
See: [Compliance Status](../../docs/compliance-status.md)
---
```

#### Fix 3: Validate All 56 Code Examples
- Extract each JavaScript block
- Test against FLUO DSL parser
- Fix or remove invalid examples

**Time Estimate:** 4-6 hours (manual review)

### Priority 2: CRITICAL (Should Fix Before Launch)

#### Fix 4: Create Landing Page
**Minimum Viable Landing Page:**
```html
<hero>
  Behavioral Assurance for OpenTelemetry Data
  Pattern matching on traces | Compliance evidence | Invariant detection
</hero>

<email-capture>
  Download Whitepapers:
  - Economics of Observability
  - Hidden Cost of Invariants
  - Multi-Tenant Security
  - Compliance Evidence
</email-capture>

<github-link>
  View Source Code: github.com/fluohq/fluo
</github-link>
```

**Time Estimate:** 1 day with template (Carrd, Webflow, or custom)

#### Fix 5: Set Up Email Infrastructure
- ConvertKit or Mailchimp account
- 3-email nurture sequence:
  - **Day 0:** Welcome + link to GitHub
  - **Day 3:** "How FLUO detects invariants" + case study
  - **Day 7:** "Getting started with FLUO" + nix run .#dev guide

**Time Estimate:** 4 hours

#### Fix 6: Update GitHub README
Add to README.md:

```markdown
## Whitepapers

- [Economics of Observability](https://fluohq.com/whitepapers/economics)
- [Hidden Cost of Invariants](https://fluohq.com/whitepapers/invariants)
- [Multi-Tenant Security](https://fluohq.com/whitepapers/security)
- [Compliance Evidence](https://fluohq.com/whitepapers/compliance)

**Note:** FLUO is a Pure Application Framework (ADR-011), not a deployment platform.
Compliance evidence generation is provided; certification requires external audit.
```

**Time Estimate:** 30 minutes

### Priority 3: NICE-TO-HAVE (Can Launch Without)

#### Fix 7: Create feature-status.md
Document what's shipped vs. roadmap

#### Fix 8: Legal Review
Have lawyer review compliance claims
