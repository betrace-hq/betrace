## 🎯 Product Analyst: Prioritized Actions

### IMMEDIATE (This Week)

#### 1. **Audit 20 SEO Blog Articles for ROI** ⚡ CRITICAL
**Problem:** 20 marketing articles exist with ZERO validation of traffic/conversions.

**Action:**
- Pull Google Analytics data: pageviews, bounce rate, conversion rate per article
- Tag each article:
  - **Keep:** Traffic + conversions
  - **Revise:** Traffic but no conversions
  - **Archive:** <100 pageviews/month

**Success Criteria:**
- If <30% of articles drive 80% of traffic → **STOP producing SEO content**
- If >50% have <100 pageviews/month → **Archive and focus on whitepapers**

**Files to Audit:**
```
marketing/marketing-articles/01-stop-fighting-alert-fatigue-pattern-based-detection-for-sres.md
marketing/marketing-articles/02-from-3-am-pages-to-proactive-prevention-how-fluo-detects-hidden-invariants.md
... (all 20 articles)
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Top 5 performers identified (double down on these)
- Bottom 10-15 archived (wasted effort)

---

#### 2. **Fix Chaos Engineering Whitepaper** ⚡ HIGH
**Problem:** 95% accurate, but claims FLUO automates chaos injection (it doesn't).

**Action:**
- Remove automation claims (lines 450-520 approximately)
- Reframe: "FLUO helps SREs formalize invariants discovered through manual chaos experiments"
- Add disclaimer: "Chaos engineering tooling (Gremlin, Chaos Mesh) is external"

**Time Estimate:** 2 hours

**File:** `marketing/whitepapers/chaos-to-confidence.md`

### HIGH-PRIORITY (Next 2 Weeks)

#### 3. **Gate Whitepapers Behind Email Signup Forms** 📧
**Goal:** Convert whitepapers into lead magnets.

**Action:**
- Create landing pages for 4 publication-ready whitepapers:
  1. Economics of Observability (10/10)
  2. Hidden Cost of Undocumented Invariants (9/10)
  3. Multi-Tenant Security Architecture (8/10)
  4. Compliance Evidence Automation (8/10)
- Implement email capture form (ConvertKit, Mailchimp, etc.)
- Set up automated email sequence: "Downloaded X? Here's how FLUO solves this..."

**Success Metric:**
- **High-value content:** 10+ email signups per whitepaper in first 30 days
- **Low-value content:** <5 signups → Revisit positioning

---

#### 4. **Create "FLUO vs. Alternatives" Comparison Page** 📊
**Problem:** Customers confuse FLUO with APM tools (Datadog) or SIEM tools (Splunk).

**Action:**
- Build comparison table:
  - **Columns:** Feature, FLUO, APM Tools (Datadog/New Relic), SIEM Tools (Splunk/Elastic)
  - **Rows:** Pattern matching on traces, Compliance evidence, Real-time threat detection, Kubernetes deployment, Infrastructure orchestration
- Explicitly state: "FLUO is a Pure Application Framework, not a platform"
- Link to ADR-011 for technical readers

**Success Metric:**
- Reduce customer confusion (track support tickets asking "Is FLUO like Datadog?")
- Conversion rate: visitors who read this page → trial signups

**Existing Comparisons (can be integrated):**
```
marketing/competitors/FLUO-vs-Datadog.md
marketing/competitors/FLUO-vs-Honeycomb.md
marketing/competitors/FLUO-vs-Cribl.md
marketing/competitors/FLUO-vs-Drata.md
marketing/competitors/FLUO-vs-Gremlin.md
marketing/competitors/FLUO-vs-LangSmith.md
marketing/competitors/FLUO-vs-Monte-Carlo.md
```

---

#### 5. **Write SOC2 Case Study** 📝
**Goal:** Show FLUO's compliance evidence workflow in practice.

**Action:**
- Write case study: "How [Company] Used FLUO to Pass SOC2 Audit"
- Structure:
  - **Problem:** Manual compliance evidence collection (160 hours)
  - **Solution:** FLUO @SOC2 annotations + compliance spans
  - **Outcome:** Auditor accepted evidence (10 hours of prep)
- Include code snippets: `@SOC2(controls = {CC6_1})`
- Include TraceQL query: `{span.compliance.framework = "soc2"}`
- **Critical Disclaimer:** "FLUO generated evidence, external auditor certified compliance. FLUO is NOT certified."

**Success Metric:**
- 50+ pageviews in first 30 days
- 3+ customer inquiries asking "Can you help us with SOC2?"

---

## ❌ WHAT TO EXPLICITLY NOT DO

### 1. **Do NOT Create More SEO Blog Articles**
**Why:** 20 articles exist with unknown ROI. Adding more is wasted effort.

**Instead:** Audit existing articles, double down on top performers, archive non-performers.

---

### 2. **Do NOT Promise Compliance Certification**
**Why:** FLUO is NOT certified for SOC2/HIPAA/FedRAMP.

**Red Flag Words to Avoid:**
- "SOC2 certified"
- "HIPAA compliant"
- "Automated compliance"
- "One-click compliance"

**Instead Use:**
- "Compliance-ready architecture"
- "Evidence generation primitives"
- "Built with SOC2 controls in mind"

**Reference:** [docs/compliance-status.md](../docs/compliance-status.md) - "FLUO is NOT certified for any compliance framework"

---

### 3. **Do NOT Claim FLUO is a Deployment Platform**
**Why:** ADR-011 explicitly states "Pure Application Framework, not a platform."

**Red Flag Words to Avoid:**
- "Deploy to Kubernetes"
- "One-click deployment"
- "Infrastructure-as-code"

**Instead Use:**
- "Pure application packages"
- "Deployment-agnostic"
- "Local dev orchestration"

**Reference:** [docs/adrs/011-pure-application-framework.md](../docs/adrs/011-pure-application-framework.md)

---

### 4. **Do NOT Claim FLUO is a SIEM/SOAR Tool**
**Why:** FLUO is for behavioral assurance on telemetry, NOT security incident response.

**Red Flag Words to Avoid:**
- "IOC-based threat detection"
- "Security incident response"
- "SOAR automation"

**Instead Use:**
- "Behavioral assurance system"
- "Invariant violation detection"
- "Trace pattern matching"

**Reference:** [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md#core-purpose) - "FLUO is NOT a SIEM/SOAR/security incident response platform"

## 🛑 BRUTAL HONESTY: What Marketing Should STOP

### STOP: Writing More Content Without Validation
**You have:**
- 4 whitepapers (133KB)
- 20 marketing articles
- 7 competitor comparisons
- Sales materials
- Educational content

**You don't need MORE content. You need to validate what's working.**

**Action:** Measure existing content performance, iterate on winners, kill losers.

---

### STOP: Claiming Features FLUO Doesn't Ship
**Already archived:**
- 3 whitepapers for "unimplemented features"
- AI agent monitoring (out of scope)

**Next:** Audit blog articles and sales decks for the same issue.

**Action:** Only claim features that are shipped and tested.

---

### STOP: Creating Marketing Materials in a Vacuum
**Problem:** No customer feedback loop. Guessing what resonates.

**Action:** Talk to 5 customers/week. Ask:
- "What made you try FLUO?"
- "What almost made you leave?"
- "What feature did you expect that wasn't there?"

---

## 📅 30-Day Success Criteria

**Content Performance:**
- ✅ Top 5 blog articles identified (archive the rest)
- ✅ 40+ email signups from whitepaper downloads
