# BeTrace vs Drata: When to Use Each (And When to Use Both)

**Last Updated:** October 2025

---

## TL;DR

**Drata**: Compliance automation platform that monitors controls, collects evidence, and manages GRC workflows for frameworks like SOC2, ISO 27001, and HIPAA.

**BeTrace**: Behavioral invariant detection system that discovers undocumented patterns in OpenTelemetry traces through rules and replays.

**When to use Drata**: You need compliance certification (SOC2, ISO 27001, HIPAA) with automated evidence collection and auditor-ready reports.

**When to use BeTrace**: You need to discover what actually happens in production by defining invariants and replaying rules against historical traces.

**When to use both**: Drata proves controls exist (compliance evidence), BeTrace proves controls work in production (behavioral validation).

---

## What is Drata?

Drata is a compliance automation platform that centralizes governance, risk, compliance, and assurance (GRC). It continuously monitors security controls, automates evidence collection, and streamlines audit preparation for frameworks like:

- SOC 2 Type I/II
- ISO 27001
- HIPAA
- PCI-DSS
- GDPR
- FedRAMP

**Core workflow:**
```
Drata integrations → Continuous control monitoring → Evidence collection → Auditor reports
```

**Value proposition**: Automate the manual work of compliance (evidence gathering, control tracking, audit preparation) and reduce audit prep time from months to weeks.

---

## What is BeTrace?

BeTrace is a behavioral invariant detection system. Code emits contextual data as OpenTelemetry spans, BeTrace DSL defines pattern-matching rules, and BeTrace engine produces signals and metrics when patterns match (or don't match).

**Core workflow:**
```
Code emits context (spans) → BeTrace DSL (pattern matching) → Signals + Metrics
```

**Key capabilities:**
1. **Pattern Matching**: Match contextual span data against user-defined rules
2. **Rule Replay**: Retroactively apply rules to historical traces (seconds, not hours)
3. **Flexible Context**: Code defines what context to emit; rules define what patterns to detect

**Value proposition**: Define patterns once, detect violations instantly, and retroactively replay rules against historical traces without expensive reprocessing.

## Key Differences

| **Dimension** | **Drata** | **BeTrace** |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| **Primary Use Case** | Compliance certification | Behavioral invariant detection |
| **Data Source** | Control integrations (Okta, AWS, GitHub) | OpenTelemetry traces |
| **Detection Method** | Control monitoring (binary: implemented/not) | Pattern matching (contextual violations) |
| **Time Dimension** | Forward-looking (monitors from now on) | Backward-looking (replays historical traces) |
| **Output** | Audit reports, evidence packages | Signals (invariant violations) |
| **Frameworks** | SOC2, ISO 27001, HIPAA (pre-defined) | Custom invariants (user-defined) |
| **Rule Replay** | No | **Yes** (key differentiator) |

## When to Use Drata

Use Drata when you need:

### 1. Compliance Certification
You're pursuing SOC2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, or other frameworks and need auditor-ready evidence.

**Example**: SaaS company pursuing SOC2 Type II for enterprise customers.

### 2. Automated Control Monitoring
You need continuous monitoring across dozens of integrations (Okta, AWS, GitHub, Jira) to prove controls are implemented.

**Example**: "Prove MFA is enabled for all employees" → Drata queries Okta API, generates evidence.

### 3. Pre-Defined Framework Mapping
You want controls automatically mapped to compliance frameworks (CC6.1 → "Logical Access Controls").

**Example**: Auditor requests evidence for CC7.2 (Monitoring) → Drata provides documentation, logs, screenshots.

### 4. Audit Workflow Management
You need task assignments, deadline tracking, and auditor collaboration tools.

**Example**: "Assign internal audit prep to security team, track 45 evidence requests from auditor."

---

## When to Use BeTrace

Use BeTrace when you need:

### 1. Behavioral Validation (Not Just Checkbox Compliance)
You want to prove controls work **in production**, not just that they're configured.

**Example**: Drata proves MFA is enabled. BeTrace proves "Every PII access is preceded by MFA authentication in traces."

**BeTrace DSL:**
```javascript
// Signal: COMPLIANCE_VIOLATION (critical)
trace.has(pii.access)
  and not trace.has(auth.mfa_verified)
```

### 2. Discovering Undocumented Invariants
You want to find patterns that break but were never explicitly documented.

**Example**: "We assumed authentication always happens before data access, but traces show 23 violations last month."

**BeTrace Rule Replay:**
- Day 30: Define rule (retrospectively)
- Replay against Days 1-29: Find 23 historical violations
- Cost: Seconds (not reprocessing millions of traces)

### 3. Custom Invariants Beyond Compliance
You need flexibility to define domain-specific patterns not covered by SOC2/ISO checklists.

**Example**: "Legal research agents should never access HR database" (organizational policy, not a compliance control).

**BeTrace DSL:**
```javascript
// Signal: POLICY_VIOLATION (high)
trace.has(agent.tool).where(role == legal_research_agent)
  and trace.has(agent.tool).where(name == hr_database)
```

### 4. AI Agent Behavioral Monitoring
You need to monitor AI agents for goal deviation, prompt injection, or unauthorized tool usage.

**Example**: Healthcare AI agent deviates from "retrieve treatment guidelines" to "schedule patient appointments" (goal deviation).

**BeTrace DSL:**
```javascript
// Signal: AGENT_GOAL_DEVIATION (high)
trace.has(agent.goal).where(role == healthcare_info_agent)
  and trace.has(agent.goal).where(deviation_score > 0.6)
```

---

## When to Use Both (The Power Combo)

The most powerful scenario is using **Drata for compliance certification** and **BeTrace for behavioral validation**.

### Scenario 1: SOC2 CC6.1 (Authorization)

**Drata proves:**
- ✅ RBAC is configured in AWS IAM
- ✅ Access control policies are documented
- ✅ Quarterly access reviews are performed

**BeTrace proves:**
- ✅ Every production data access follows authorization check in traces
- ✅ No privilege escalation patterns detected
- ✅ Replay rule across 90 days: 0 violations

**Integration:**
```javascript
// BeTrace DSL for CC6.1 behavioral validation
// Signal: SOC2_CC6_1_VIOLATION (critical)
trace.has(data.access)
  and not trace.has(auth.check)
// Optionally: emit to Drata via API for evidence
```

**Result**: Auditor sees both:
1. **Drata evidence**: Authorization controls exist
2. **BeTrace evidence**: Authorization controls work in production (trace-level proof)

---

### Scenario 2: HIPAA 164.312(b) (Audit Controls)

**Drata proves:**
- ✅ Audit logging is enabled (Cloudtrail, database logs)
- ✅ Logs are retained for 6 years
- ✅ Log review processes are documented

**BeTrace proves:**
- ✅ Every PHI access generates audit log span
- ✅ No PHI access without corresponding audit span
- ✅ Replay rule across Q4 2024: 100% coverage

**BeTrace DSL:**
```javascript
// Signal: HIPAA_164_312_b_VIOLATION (critical)
trace.has(phi.access)
  and not trace.has(audit.log)
```

**Result**: Drata handles auditor workflow, BeTrace provides behavioral proof from traces.

---

### Scenario 3: Incident Investigation + Compliance

**Day 1-29**: Normal operations, Drata monitors controls.

**Day 30**: Security incident (unauthorized data access).

**Drata workflow:**
- Document incident in GRC platform
- Trigger control re-assessment
- Generate incident report for auditor

**BeTrace workflow:**
- Define new invariant: "No after-hours database access by contractors"
- **Rule replay**: Check Days 1-29 traces
- Discovery: 7 historical violations (same attacker)
- Cost: Seconds (vs. days of log reprocessing)

**BeTrace DSL:**
```javascript
// Signal: SECURITY_INCIDENT (critical)
trace.has(database.access).where(user.role == contractor)
  and trace.has(database.access).where(timestamp.hour >= 18 or timestamp.hour <= 6)
```

**Result**: Drata tracks compliance impact, BeTrace discovers attack timeline via replay.
