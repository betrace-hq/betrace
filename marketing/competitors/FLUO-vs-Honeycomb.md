# FLUO vs Honeycomb: When to Use Each (And When to Use Both)

**Last Updated:** October 2025

---

## TL;DR

**Honeycomb**: High-cardinality observability platform for exploring traces, events, and logs with powerful querying (BubbleUp, Trace Waterfall).

**FLUO**: Behavioral invariant detection system - code emits context via spans, FLUO DSL matches patterns, produces signals and metrics.

**When to use Honeycomb**: You need high-cardinality exploration, asking "why is this slow?" or "what's different about these traces?"

**When to use FLUO**: You need pattern matching on contextual trace data and rule replay against historical traces.

**When to use both**: Honeycomb explores anomalies ("what's different?"), FLUO validates invariants ("did this pattern occur?").

---

## What is Honeycomb?

Honeycomb is a high-cardinality observability platform built for exploring complex systems through distributed tracing, events, and logs. It excels at answering questions like "why is this request slow?" or "what changed between deployments?"

**Core capabilities:**
- **BubbleUp**: Automatically finds characteristics of slow/error traces
- **Trace Waterfall**: Visualize distributed request flow across services
- **High-Cardinality Queries**: Group by any attribute (user_id, endpoint, region)
- **Query Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for ad-hoc exploration

**Core workflow:**
```
Instrumented code → Honeycomb (events/traces) → Query + Explore → Root cause discovery
```

**Value proposition**: Explore production systems interactively without pre-defined dashboards - ask questions, get answers from high-cardinality data.

---

## What is FLUO?

FLUO is a behavioral invariant detection system. Code emits contextual data as OpenTelemetry spans, FLUO DSL defines pattern-matching rules, and FLUO engine produces signals and metrics when patterns match (or don't match).

**Core workflow:**
```
Code emits context (spans) → FLUO DSL (pattern matching) → Signals + Metrics
```

**Key capabilities:**
1. **Pattern Matching**: Match contextual span data against user-defined rules
2. **Rule Replay**: Retroactively apply rules to historical traces (seconds, not hours)
3. **Flexible Context**: Code defines what context to emit; rules define what patterns to detect

**Value proposition**: Define patterns once, detect violations instantly, and retroactively replay rules against historical traces without expensive reprocessing.

## Key Differences

| **Dimension** | **Honeycomb** | **FLUO** |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| **Primary Focus** | Exploration (interactive queries) | Pattern matching (rule-based detection) |
| **User Interaction** | Manual (ask questions via UI) | Automated (rules always-on) |
| **Detection Method** | BubbleUp, manual filtering | FLUO DSL pattern matching |
| **Rule Replay** | Manual re-query | **Yes** (automated replay) |
| **Output** | Query results, visualizations | Signals (pattern violations) |
| **Use Case** | "Why is this slow?" (debugging) | "Did this happen?" (validation) |

---

## When to Use Honeycomb

Use Honeycomb when you need:

### 1. Interactive Exploration of Production Issues
You want to ask questions about production behavior without knowing the answer upfront.

**Example**: "Why is checkout slow for users in EU region?"

**Honeycomb workflow:**
1. Filter traces: `endpoint=/checkout AND latency > 1000ms AND region=EU`
2. BubbleUp analysis: Identifies `payment_gateway=stripe-eu` in slow traces
3. Drill down: View trace waterfall, find slow span (3rd-party API)

**Why not FLUO?**
- Honeycomb excels at ad-hoc exploration (manual queries)
- FLUO excels at automated pattern detection (pre-defined rules)

---

### 2. Comparing Good vs Bad Traces
You want to find "what's different" between working and broken requests.

**Example**: "Why do 5% of API calls return 500 errors?"

**Honeycomb workflow:**
1. Query: `status_code=500` vs `status_code=200`
2. BubbleUp: Highlights `database_connection_pool=exhausted` in error traces
3. Root cause: Connection pool too small for load spikes

**Why not FLUO?**
- Honeycomb's BubbleUp automatically finds differences
- FLUO requires you to define patterns as rules

---

### 3. High-Cardinality Grouping
You want to group traces by attributes with thousands of values (user IDs, endpoints, IPs).

**Example**: "Which users experience the most timeouts?"

**Honeycomb query:**
```
BREAKDOWN(user_id)
WHERE error_type=timeout
ORDER BY COUNT DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**Result**: Top 10 users with timeouts (e.g., user `abc123` has 47 timeouts).

**Why not FLUO?**
- Honeycomb optimized for high-cardinality grouping
- FLUO focuses on pattern matching (not aggregation)

---

### 4. Root Cause Analysis with Trace Waterfall
You want to visualize request flow across microservices to find bottlenecks.

**Example**: "Which service is causing 3-second latency in checkout?"

**Honeycomb trace waterfall:**
- Frontend: 50ms
- API Gateway: 20ms
- **Order Service: 2,800ms** (bottleneck!)
  - Database query: 2,750ms (slow query identified)

**Why not FLUO?**
- Honeycomb visualizes trace structure (flamegraphs, waterfall)
- FLUO validates trace structure (pattern matching)

---

## When to Use FLUO

Use FLUO when you need:

### 1. Automated Pattern Detection (Always-On)
You want rules to continuously validate expected behavior without manual queries.

**Example**: "Every checkout must include `fraud.check` span."

**FLUO DSL:**
```javascript
// Signal: FRAUD_CHECK_MISSING (critical)
trace.has(checkout.complete)
  and not trace.has(fraud.check)
```

**FLUO workflow:**
1. Define rule once
2. FLUO engine runs continuously
3. Signal emitted when pattern violated

**Why not Honeycomb?**
- Honeycomb requires manual queries (reactive)
- FLUO runs rules automatically (proactive)

---

### 2. Rule Replay on Historical Traces
You want to apply rules retroactively to historical data **without re-querying manually**.

**Example**: Day 30 - discover new pattern violation. Replay rule against Days 1-29.

**FLUO workflow:**
1. Day 30: Define rule ("API key should never be in query params")
2. Rule replay: Apply to Days 1-29 traces (seconds)
3. Discovery: 52 historical violations

**Cost comparison:**
- Honeycomb manual re-query: Run same query 29 times (manual)
- FLUO replay: Automated replay across historical traces (seconds)

**Why not Honeycomb?**
- Honeycomb: Manual re-query for each time range
- FLUO: Automated replay with single rule definition

---

### 3. Complex Multi-Span Pattern Matching
You want to validate relationships across multiple spans in a trace.

**Example**: "Database writes must always follow `transaction.begin` span."

**FLUO DSL:**
```javascript
// Signal: TRANSACTION_INVARIANT_VIOLATION (high)
trace.has(database.operation).where(operation == write)
  and not trace.has(transaction.begin)
```

**Why not Honeycomb?**
- Honeycomb: Query can filter spans, but requires manual query construction
- FLUO: Rule always-on, automatically detects violations

---

### 4. Validation of Expected Patterns
You want to assert "this should never happen" and get alerted when it does.

**Example**: "Cross-tenant data access should never occur."

**FLUO DSL:**
```javascript
// Signal: TENANT_ISOLATION_VIOLATION (critical)
trace.has(database.query).where(tenant.id == tenant-A)
  and trace.has(database.query).where(table matches ".*tenant_b_data.*")
```

**Why not Honeycomb?**
- Honeycomb: Great for exploration ("did cross-tenant access happen?")
- FLUO: Great for validation ("alert me if it ever happens")

---

## When to Use Both (The Power Combo)

The most powerful scenario is using **Honeycomb for exploration** and **FLUO for validation**.

### Scenario 1: Payment Gateway Integration

**Honeycomb explores:**
- "Why are payment failures up 20%?"
- Query: `payment.status=failed`, BubbleUp → finds `gateway=stripe` failures
- Drill down: Trace waterfall shows 3rd-party timeout

**FLUO validates:**
- "Payment retries should never exceed 3 attempts"
- FLUO DSL:
```javascript
// Signal: PAYMENT_RETRY_VIOLATION (high)
trace.has(payment.charge).where(retries > 3)
```

**Result**:
- Honeycomb: Debug **why** failures happen (ad-hoc investigation)
- FLUO: Validate **expected behavior** (automated detection)

---

### Scenario 2: Feature Rollout Validation

**Day 1**: Deploy new feature (A/B test: 10% traffic).

**Honeycomb explores:**
- "Are users in treatment group experiencing errors?"
- Query: `experiment.group=treatment AND error=true`
- BubbleUp: No significant differences found

**FLUO validates:**
- "Treatment group requests must include `experiment.variant` span"
- FLUO DSL:
```javascript
// Signal: EXPERIMENT_TRACKING_MISSING (medium)
trace.has(experiment.group).where(group == treatment)
  and not trace.has(experiment.variant)
```

**Result**:
- Honeycomb: Explore impact of feature (manual analysis)
- FLUO: Validate instrumentation complete (automated)

---

### Scenario 3: Multi-Tenant SaaS Investigation

**Incident**: User reports "can see other tenant's data."

**Honeycomb investigation:**
1. Query: `user_id=abc123 AND tenant_id=tenant-A`
2. Drill down: Find trace with `database.table=tenant_b_data` (cross-tenant access!)
3. Root cause: Missing tenant filter in query

**FLUO replay:**
1. Define rule: "Tenant A should never access Tenant B data"
2. Replay rule against last 30 days
3. Discovery: 8 historical occurrences (same bug, different users)

**FLUO DSL:**
```javascript
// Signal: TENANT_ISOLATION_VIOLATION (critical)
trace.has(database.query).where(tenant.id == tenant-A)
  and trace.has(database.query).where(table == tenant_b_data)
```

**Result**:
- Honeycomb: Debug current incident (manual exploration)
- FLUO: Find historical violations via replay (automated)

**Data flow:**
1. **Application code** emits OpenTelemetry traces with contextual attributes
2. **Honeycomb** stores traces for interactive exploration
3. **FLUO** stores traces for pattern matching via rules
4. **Operations team** uses both:
   - Honeycomb: Ad-hoc debugging ("why is checkout slow?")
   - FLUO: Automated validation ("did cross-tenant access happen?")

## Cost Comparison

| **Dimension** | **Honeycomb** | **FLUO** |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| **Pricing Model** | Per-event pricing (volume-based) | Per-trace volume |
| **Typical Cost** | $0.50-$2 per million events | Custom pricing |
| **Data Retention** | 60 days (standard), longer ($$) | Configurable |
| **Cost Optimization** | Sampling, dropping high-volume events | Span attribute pruning |

**When cost matters:**
- **Honeycomb**: Cost scales with event volume (sample aggressively at scale)
- **FLUO**: Cost scales with trace volume (optimize by controlling span attributes)

**Combined approach:**
- Honeycomb: Sample traces at 10% for exploration (reduce cost)
- FLUO: 100% traces for pattern validation (critical patterns always captured)
