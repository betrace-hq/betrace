2. [compliance.md](../../../docs/compliance.md) - How the system works
3. [ai-content-guidelines.md](../ai-content-guidelines.md) - Compliance claims rules
4. [CLAUDE.md](../../../CLAUDE.md) - Core workflow

**Supplementary Sources:**

## CRITICAL: What to Say vs NOT Say

### ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE CLAIMS
- "FLUO provides compliance evidence collection primitives"
- "Built with SOC2/HIPAA controls in mind"
- "Compliance-ready architecture for behavioral assurance"
- "Compliance evidence generation (NOT certification)"

### ‚ùå NEVER CLAIM
- "SOC2 certified" (NOT TRUE - requires external audit)
- "HIPAA compliant" (NOT TRUE - requires BAAs, policies)
- "Automated compliance" (evidence ‚â† certification)
- "Production-ready for compliance" (NOT TRUE - see compliance-status.md)

### üö® IF ASKED ABOUT CERTIFICATION
"FLUO is NOT certified for any framework. Certification requires external auditor, 12-18 months, and $10-25K. FLUO provides evidence collection primitives only."

---

## Documented Facts (Current Reality)

### Implemented (Production Ready)
- ‚úÖ Compliance span integrity (HMAC-SHA256 signatures)
- ‚úÖ PII redaction enforcement (whitelist-based validation)
- ‚úÖ Rule engine sandboxing (9.5/10 security rating)
- ‚úÖ Input sanitization (XSS, SQL, LDAP, command injection)
- ‚úÖ Compliance audit logging (SOC2 spans for security events)

### NOT Implemented (Be Honest!)
- ‚ùå NOT certified for any framework (SOC2, HIPAA, FedRAMP, etc.)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Per-tenant KMS encryption keys (P1, not blocking)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Evidence export API for auditors (P2)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Compliance rule templates (P2)

## Article Structure

### Section 1: The Problem (150 words)
**What to cover:**
- Compliance audits require evidence of controls
- Manual evidence collection is time-consuming
- Need to prove controls work in production, not just documented

**Sources:**
- compliance.md (overview)
- compliance-status.md (current challenges)

**DO NOT CLAIM:**
- ‚ùå "Compliance is automated" (false!)
- ‚ùå "FLUO replaces auditors" (false!)

### Section 2: How FLUO Generates Evidence (300 words)
**What to cover:**
- FLUO emits compliance spans during normal operations
- Spans are cryptographically signed (HMAC-SHA256)
- Immutable, timestamped audit trail via OpenTelemetry
- Spans are queryable for auditor review

**Sources:**
- compliance.md (how it works)
- compliance-status.md (implemented features)

**Example (from compliance.md):**
```java
@SOC2(controls = {CC6_1}, notes = "User authorization check")
public boolean authorizeUser(String userId, String resource) {
    // Emits compliance span with:
    // - framework: "soc2"
    // - control: "CC6_1"
    // - evidenceType: "audit_trail"
    return authService.check(userId, resource);
}
```

### Section 3: FLUO DSL for Compliance Validation (300 words)
**What to cover:**
- Rules verify compliance patterns exist in traces
- Example: PII access requires audit log
- Violations generate signals (broken invariants = missing evidence)

**Sources:**
- trace-rules-dsl.md (DSL syntax)
- compliance.md (compliance examples)

**Real Example (from compliance.md):**
```javascript
// SOC2 CC7_2: PII access requires audit logging
trace.has(span => span.attributes['data.contains_pii'] === true)
  .and(trace.has(span => span.name === 'audit.log'))
```

**DO NOT INVENT:**
- ‚ùå No fictional controls or frameworks
- ‚ùå No invented compliance rules
- ‚ùå No client stories unless from docs

### Section 4: Supported Frameworks (200 words)
**What to cover:**
- SOC2 Trust Service Criteria (CC6.1, CC6.2, CC7.1, CC7.2, CC8.1)
- HIPAA Technical Safeguards (164.312(a), 164.312(b))
- Extensible to ISO27001, FedRAMP, PCI-DSS

**Sources:**
- compliance.md (framework support section)

**CRITICAL:** Must state this clearly:
> "FLUO provides evidence generation for these frameworks but is NOT CERTIFIED. Certification requires external auditor."

### Section 5: Path to Certification (200 words)
**What to cover (from compliance-status.md):**
1. Fix P0 security gaps: ‚úÖ DONE
2. Implement compliance rule templates: ‚è∏Ô∏è Planned
3. Deploy FLUO with annotations: ‚è∏Ô∏è Customer responsibility
4. Run for audit period: ‚è∏Ô∏è 6-12 months minimum
5. External audit: ‚è∏Ô∏è $10-25K, 2-3 months
6. **Total timeline:** 12-18 months from today

**Sources:**
- compliance-status.md ("Path to Certification" section)

**BE HONEST:**
- Costs: $10,000-25,000 for SOC2 Type II
- Timeline: 12-18 months minimum
- Requires: External auditor (CPA for SOC2, 3PAO for FedRAMP)

### Section 6: Current Status & Limitations (150 words)
**What to cover:**
- What's implemented vs planned
- What FLUO does NOT provide (policies, BAAs, documentation)
- What organizations still need to do

**Sources:**
- compliance-status.md ("What FLUO Does NOT Provide")

**Example from docs:**
> "FLUO generates technical evidence, not documentation. Organizations must maintain security policies, procedures, and documentation separately."

## Critical Constraints (AI Must Follow)

### ‚úÖ MUST DO
1. State upfront: "FLUO is NOT certified for any framework"
2. Cite compliance-status.md for all claims
3. Provide realistic timeline (12-18 months) and costs ($10-25K)
4. Acknowledge gaps: "No evidence export API yet"

### ‚ùå MUST NOT DO
1. Claim SOC2/HIPAA certification (false!)
2. Say "automated compliance" (misleading!)
3. Imply FLUO replaces auditors (false!)
4. Invent compliance controls or examples

### üö® IF YOU NEED COMPLIANCE EXAMPLES NOT IN DOCS
Write: `[COMPLIANCE EXAMPLE NEEDED: describe control]`

**DO NOT INVENT COMPLIANCE CLAIMS!**

## Success Criteria

**Article succeeds if:**
1. States upfront: "NOT certified"
2. Provides realistic timeline and costs
3. Cites compliance-status.md extensively
4. Honestly acknowledges gaps
5. Distinguishes evidence generation from certification

**Article fails if:**
1. Claims SOC2/HIPAA certification
2. Says "automated compliance"
3. Omits costs or timeline
4. Invents controls or examples
5. Misleads about what FLUO provides
