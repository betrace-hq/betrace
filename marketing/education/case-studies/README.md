## 1. Payment Idempotency Failure ($2.4M, E-Commerce)

### Company Profile

- **Industry:** E-commerce marketplace
- **Size:** 500 employees, $120M ARR
- **Product:** B2C marketplace with 2M active users
- **Technology:** Stripe payment processor, microservices architecture

### The Undocumented Invariant

**Invariant:** "Payment retries should always use the same payment_intent_id (idempotency)"

**Where documented:** Nowhere. Original developer knew this, but knowledge never formalized.

### Incident Timeline

**Quarter 1-3 (9 months):** System works correctly
- Stripe integration handles payments
- Retry logic implemented for transient failures
- Idempotency keys used correctly
- ~$50M in payment volume processed

**Quarter 4, Week 1:** Black Friday preparation
- New developer adds "aggressive retry" logic to improve success rate
- Goal: Reduce failed checkouts during high traffic
- Generates new `payment_intent_id` on each retry (didn't know about idempotency requirement)
- Code review focuses on performance, not correctness
- Load tests pass (test environment uses mocked Stripe API)

**Black Friday, Hour 1-6:**
- 10x normal traffic (200K checkouts/hour)
- Network timeouts increase due to load
- Retry logic triggers frequently
- **4,247 customers charged twice** (double payment)
- Average charge: $200

**Black Friday, Hour 7:**
- Support tickets flood in: "I was charged twice!"
- 127 tickets in first hour
- On-call engineer paged
- Investigation begins

**Black Friday, Hour 8-10:**
- Root cause identified: New retry logic generates new payment_intent_id
- Fix deployed: Rollback to previous version
- Damage already done: 4,247 double-charges

**Black Friday, Days 2-7:**
- Process refunds for all affected customers
- Customer support overwhelmed (1,200 hours)
- Social media backlash: #DoubleCharged trending on Twitter
- PR crisis management activated

### Financial Impact

**Direct costs:**
- Customer refunds: $847,000 (4,247 customers × $200 average)
- Payment processing fees (non-refundable): $25,410 (3% × $847K)
- Customer support: 1,200 hours × $50/hour = $60,000
- Engineering incident response: 240 hours × $150/hour = $36,000
- **Direct total: $968,410**

**Indirect costs:**
- Customer churn: 847 customers (20% of affected) × $1,417 LTV = $1,200,000
- Brand damage: Social media crisis management = $120,000
- Lost Black Friday revenue: Checkout disabled 6 hours = $180,000
- **Indirect total: $1,500,000**

**Total cost: $2,468,410**

### Root Cause Analysis

**Technical root cause:** Retry logic generated new payment_intent_id instead of reusing existing one

**Process failure:**
1. Invariant never documented (existed only in original developer's head)
2. Code review didn't catch violation (no invariant checklist)
3. Load tests didn't detect issue (mocked Stripe in test environment)
4. No production validation (monitoring tracked success rate, not idempotency)

### How FLUO Would Have Prevented This

**Define the invariant (Day 1 of original implementation):**

```javascript
// Payment retries must reuse payment_intent_id
trace.has(payment.charge).where(attempt > 1)
  and trace.count(payment.charge).where(payment_intent_id == unique) == 1
```

**Instrumentation (original code):**

```python
def charge_payment(cart, payment_method, attempt=1):
    payment_intent_id = get_or_create_intent_id(cart.id)

    with tracer.start_span("payment.charge") as span:
        span.set_attribute("amount", cart.total)
        span.set_attribute("payment_intent_id", payment_intent_id)
        span.set_attribute("attempt", attempt)
        span.set_attribute("cart.id", cart.id)

        charge_stripe(payment_intent_id, cart.total)
```

**What would have happened:**

**Quarter 4, Week 1:**
- New retry logic deployed to staging
- **30 minutes later:** FLUO detects violation in staging environment
- Alert fires: "Payment retry using new payment_intent_id"
- Developer reviews alert, realizes mistake
- Fix deployed: Reuse existing intent_id
- **Cost: $300** (2 hours engineer time)

**Result:** Incident prevented before production deployment

**Cost avoided: $2.47M** (8,227x ROI)

### Lessons Learned

1. **Document invariants explicitly** - "Everyone knows" is not documentation
2. **Load tests must use real integrations** - Mocked Stripe didn't catch idempotency violation
3. **Code review checklists matter** - "Does this preserve idempotency?" should be standard
4. **Production validation is critical** - Tests can't cover all scenarios

### Action Items (Post-Incident)

- [ ] Document all payment invariants (idempotency, amount limits, refund rules)
- [ ] Add FLUO rules for payment flow validation
- [ ] Update code review checklist with invariant questions
- [ ] Improve load testing (use Stripe test mode, not mocks)
- [ ] Train team on payment idempotency patterns

## 2. Cross-Tenant Data Breach ($847K, Healthcare SaaS)

### Company Profile

- **Industry:** Healthcare SaaS
- **Size:** 200 employees, $25M ARR
- **Product:** Patient records management (HIPAA-regulated)
- **Customers:** 47 healthcare providers (hospitals, clinics)

### The Undocumented Invariant

**Invariant:** "Tenant A should never access Tenant B's patient data"

**Where documented:** Architecture diagram (high-level), not enforced in code

### Incident Timeline

**Month 1-11:** Multi-tenant system works correctly
- Database row-level security (RLS) enforces tenant isolation
- Developers "know" to filter by tenant_id in queries
- No cross-tenant incidents

**Month 12, Week 1:** New feature deployed (bulk export)
- Product manager requests "export all patient records" feature
- Developer implements bulk export functionality
- SQL query missing `WHERE tenant_id = ?` filter
- Code review doesn't catch it (no tenant isolation checklist)
- Tests don't cover cross-tenant scenarios (all tests use single tenant)

**Month 12, Week 2:**
- Customer A uses bulk export feature
- Receives 47,892 patient records (not just their 1,203 records)
- **Includes patient data from 3 other customers**
- Customer A notices unfamiliar patient names, reports to support

**Month 12, Week 2, Day 3:**
- Security team investigates
- Discovery: SQL query missing tenant filter
- Forensic analysis: 4 customers affected
- HIPAA breach notification required (47,892 records exposed)

**Month 12, Week 3-12:**
- HHS investigation (HIPAA violation)
- Legal consultations (breach disclosure requirements)
- Breach notification letters (47,892 patients)
- Customer churn (2 enterprise customers leave)

### Financial Impact

**Direct costs:**
- HIPAA breach fine: $250,000 (HHS investigation, Tier 2 violation)
- Legal fees: $120,000 (3 months, breach disclosure)
- Forensic analysis: $45,000 (external security consultant)
- Breach notification: $12,000 (47,892 letters, certified mail)
- **Direct total: $427,000**

**Indirect costs:**
- Customer churn: 2 enterprise customers × $120K ARR = $240,000 (2-year impact)
- Sales impact: Delayed deals, 6 months lost pipeline = $180,000
- Engineering time: 400 hours × $150/hour = $60,000
- **Indirect total: $480,000**

**Reputation damage:**
- Press coverage (negative): 3 healthcare trade publications
- Industry trust loss: 18 months to recover market position
- Board scrutiny: CISO replacement

**Total cost: $907,000**

### Root Cause Analysis

**Technical root cause:** SQL query missing `WHERE tenant_id = ?` filter

**Process failure:**
1. Tenant isolation invariant documented in architecture, not enforced in code
2. No automated validation of tenant filtering
3. Tests didn't cover cross-tenant scenarios
4. Code review lacked tenant isolation checklist

### How FLUO Would Have Prevented This

**Define the invariant (Day 1 of multi-tenant architecture):**

```javascript
// Cross-tenant isolation: queries must filter by tenant
trace.has(database.query).where(table contains "patient_records")
  and trace.has(database.query).where(tenant_filter == true)
```

**Instrumentation:**

```python
def export_patient_records(tenant_id):
    with tracer.start_span("tenant.context_loaded") as span:
        span.set_attribute("tenant.id", tenant_id)
        load_tenant_context(tenant_id)

    with tracer.start_span("database.query") as span:
        span.set_attribute("table", "patient_records")
        span.set_attribute("tenant.id", tenant_id)
        span.set_attribute("tenant_filter", True)  # ← Critical attribute

        query = f"""
            SELECT * FROM patient_records
            WHERE tenant_id = {tenant_id}
        """
        records = db.execute(query)

    return records
```

**What would have happened:**

**Month 12, Week 1:**
- New bulk export code deployed to staging
- **15 minutes later:** FLUO detects violation
  - `trace.has(database.query)` ✅
  - `trace.has(database.query).where(tenant_filter == true)` ❌
- Alert fires: "Database query missing tenant filter"
- Developer reviews, adds WHERE clause
- Re-deploy to staging, FLUO validates ✅
- **Cost: $150** (1 hour engineer time)

**Result:** Incident prevented before production

**Cost avoided: $907,000** (6,047x ROI)

### Lessons Learned

1. **Architectural invariants must be enforced** - Diagrams aren't enough
2. **Cross-tenant tests are critical** - Single-tenant tests miss isolation bugs
3. **Span attributes enable validation** - `tenant_filter=true` makes invariant checkable
4. **Security invariants = compliance invariants** - Same pattern for HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR

### Action Items (Post-Incident)

- [ ] Define tenant isolation invariants (FLUO DSL)
- [ ] Instrument all database queries with tenant context
- [ ] Add cross-tenant integration tests
- [ ] Code review checklist: "Does this query filter by tenant_id?"
- [ ] Quarterly tenant isolation audits

## 3. Missing Audit Logs ($308K, Fintech)

### Company Profile

- **Industry:** Fintech (small business lending)
- **Size:** 150 employees, $40M ARR
- **Product:** Loan origination platform
- **Compliance:** SOC2 Type II certified

### The Undocumented Invariant

**Invariant:** "Admin actions should always generate audit logs (SOC2 CC7.2)"

**Where documented:** SOC2 control documentation, not enforced in code

### Incident Timeline

**Year 1:** SOC2 certification achieved
- Audit logging implemented for admin actions
- Auditor reviews code, logs, policies
- SOC2 Type II certification granted
- All enterprise deals require SOC2

**Year 2, Month 3:** New admin feature deployed
- Product manager requests "bulk user deactivation" (admin tool)
- Developer implements feature (works correctly functionally)
- Forgets to add audit logging (copy-paste from non-admin code)
- Code review doesn't catch it (no SOC2 checklist)
- Feature ships to production

**Year 2, Months 3-12:** Feature used in production
- 47 bulk deactivations performed by admins
- No audit logs generated (violates SOC2 CC7.2)
- No alerts fired (monitoring tracks errors, not compliance patterns)
- Admins don't notice (functionality works)

**Year 2, Month 12:** SOC2 renewal audit begins
- External auditor requests admin action logs for Q4
- Auditor samples 50 admin actions for review
- **Discovery: 47 bulk deactivations have no audit logs**
- Control failure: SOC2 CC7.2 (System Monitoring) violated

**Year 2, Month 12, Week 2:** Audit impact
- Auditor issues "Qualified Opinion" (not full pass)
- Requires 6 months of corrective evidence
- Re-audit required after remediation

**Year 2, Month 12-18:** Remediation period
- Fix deployed (add audit logging)
- 6 months of evidence collection
- Re-audit performed

### Financial Impact

**Direct costs:**
- Re-audit fee: $35,000
- Legal/compliance consulting: $45,000
- Engineering remediation: 320 hours × $150/hour = $48,000
- **Direct total: $128,000**

**Indirect costs:**
- Enterprise deal lost (customer requires current SOC2): $180K ARR
- Sales cycle extended (trust rebuilding): 3 months delay
- Board reputation damage (CFO and CTO questioned)

**Total cost: $308,000** (direct + first-year lost revenue)

### Root Cause Analysis

**Technical root cause:** Bulk deactivation feature missing audit log call

**Process failure:**
1. SOC2 invariant documented in compliance docs, not enforced in code
2. No automated compliance validation
3. Code review lacked compliance checklist
4. No production monitoring for compliance patterns

### How FLUO Would Have Prevented This

**Define the invariant (Day 1 of SOC2 certification):**

```javascript
// Admin actions require audit logs (SOC2 CC7.2)
trace.has(admin.action)
  and trace.has(audit.log)
```

**Instrumentation:**

```python
def bulk_deactivate_users(admin_id, user_ids):
    with tracer.start_span("admin.action") as span:
        span.set_attribute("admin.id", admin_id)
        span.set_attribute("action", "bulk_deactivate")
        span.set_attribute("user_count", len(user_ids))
        span.set_attribute("compliance.framework", "SOC2")
        span.set_attribute("compliance.control", "CC7.2")

        for user_id in user_ids:
            deactivate_user(user_id)

    with tracer.start_span("audit.log") as span:
        span.set_attribute("admin.id", admin_id)
        span.set_attribute("action", "bulk_deactivate")
        span.set_attribute("affected_users", user_ids)
        log_audit_event("bulk_deactivate", admin_id, user_ids)
```

**What would have happened:**

**Year 2, Month 3:**
- New bulk deactivation feature deployed to production
- **Day 1, first use:** FLUO detects violation
  - `trace.has(admin.action)` ✅
  - `trace.has(audit.log)` ❌
- Alert fires: "Admin action without audit log (SOC2 CC7.2 violation)"
- Developer reviews, adds audit logging
- Fix deployed same day
- **Cost: $600** (4 hours engineer time)

**Result:** Compliance gap closed before audit

**Cost avoided: $308,000** (513x ROI)

### Lessons Learned

1. **Compliance invariants must be enforced in code** - Documentation isn't enough
2. **Annotations bridge compliance and code** - `@SOC2(CC7_2)` makes requirement explicit
3. **Continuous compliance validation** - Not just during audit prep
4. **Alert on first violation** - Don't wait for auditor discovery

### Action Items (Post-Incident)

- [ ] Define all SOC2 invariants (FLUO DSL)
- [ ] Add compliance annotations to admin actions
- [ ] Instrument audit logging with compliance spans
- [ ] Code review checklist: "Does this admin action have audit log?"
- [ ] Monthly compliance validation reports

## 4. API Rate Limiting Bypass ($180K, API Platform)

### Company Profile

- **Industry:** API-as-a-Service platform
- **Size:** 120 employees, $18M ARR
- **Product:** REST API platform with usage-based pricing
- **Pricing:** Tiered (free, pro, enterprise) with rate limits

### The Undocumented Invariant

**Invariant:** "Free-tier API requests should always be rate-limited to 100/minute"

**Where documented:** Pricing page, not enforced correctly in code

### Incident Timeline

**Quarter 1-2:** Rate limiting works correctly
- Free tier: 100 requests/minute
- Pro tier: 1,000 requests/minute
- Enterprise: Unlimited
- Rate limiter middleware enforces limits

**Quarter 3, Week 1:** New caching layer deployed
- Performance optimization: Redis cache for responses
- Cache hits bypass rate limiter (intentional, to improve latency)
- **Bug:** Cache key doesn't include tier information
- Free-tier users can exhaust cache, then get unlimited requests

**Quarter 3, Week 2-8:**
- 3 free-tier users discover loophole (reverse-engineer cache behavior)
- Generate 5,000+ requests/minute (50x over limit)
- Share exploit on dev forums
- 47 additional free-tier users exploit vulnerability

**Quarter 3, Week 9:**
- Enterprise customer complains about slow API performance
- Investigation reveals 50 free-tier users consuming 70% of API capacity
- **Estimated loss:** 50 users × 8 weeks × $45/month pro plan = $14,400
- **Infrastructure costs:** $165K excess AWS charges (8 weeks)

### Financial Impact

**Direct costs:**
- Excess infrastructure: $165,000 (8 weeks of overload)
- Lost subscription revenue: $14,400 (should have been pro tier)
- **Direct total: $179,400**

**Opportunity cost:**
- 2 enterprise deals delayed (performance issues) = $80K ARR

**Total cost: $259,400**

### Root Cause Analysis

**Technical root cause:** Cache key missing tier information, rate limiter bypassed for cache hits

**Process failure:**
1. Rate limit invariant not validated in production
2. Caching layer introduced without rate limit testing
3. No monitoring for tier violations

### How FLUO Would Have Prevented This

**Define the invariant:**

```javascript
// Free-tier users must be rate-limited
trace.has(api.request).where(tier == free and request_count_1m > 100)
```

**Instrumentation:**

```python
def handle_api_request(user_id, endpoint):
    user_tier = get_user_tier(user_id)

    with tracer.start_span("api.request") as span:
        span.set_attribute("user.id", user_id)
        span.set_attribute("tier", user_tier)
        span.set_attribute("endpoint", endpoint)

        # Check cache
        cached = redis.get(cache_key)
        if cached:
            span.set_attribute("cache_hit", True)
            return cached

        # Check rate limit
        with tracer.start_span("rate_limit.check") as rl_span:
            rl_span.set_attribute("tier", user_tier)
            check_rate_limit(user_id, user_tier)

        response = process_request(endpoint)
        redis.set(cache_key, response)
        return response
```

**What would have happened:**

**Quarter 3, Week 2:**
- First free-tier user exploits cache bypass
- **2 minutes later:** FLUO detects violation
  - `trace.has(api.request).where(tier == free)` ✅
  - `request_count_1m > 100` ✅ (violation)
  - `not trace.has(rate_limit.check)` ❌
- Alert fires: "Free-tier user exceeding rate limit"
- Investigation reveals cache bypass bug
- Fix deployed: Include tier in cache key
- **Cost: $900** (6 hours engineer time)

**Result:** Exploit closed after 2 minutes, not 8 weeks

**Cost avoided: $259,000** (288x ROI)

### Lessons Learned

1. **Performance optimizations can violate invariants** - Cache bypass skipped rate limit
2. **Resource invariants matter** - Rate limits = revenue protection
3. **Monitor tier boundaries** - Free-tier abuse impacts paying customers

### Action Items (Post-Incident)

- [ ] Define rate limit invariants for all tiers
- [ ] Instrument cache layer with tier context
- [ ] Add FLUO rules for tier violation detection
- [ ] Quarterly rate limit audits

## 5. Inventory Race Condition ($450K, Marketplace)

### Company Profile

- **Industry:** Online marketplace
- **Size:** 300 employees, $60M ARR
- **Product:** B2C marketplace for limited-edition items
- **Model:** Single inventory item (first-come, first-served)

### The Undocumented Invariant

**Invariant:** "Inventory reservation must occur before payment charge"

**Where documented:** Implicit in checkout flow design

### Incident Timeline

**Month 1-5:** Checkout works correctly (low concurrency)

**Month 6:** Limited-edition drop (high concurrency)
- 50,000 users trying to buy 1,000 items
- Concurrent requests: 500/second
- **Race condition triggered:**
  - Thread 1: Reserve inventory (item_id=123)
  - Thread 2: Reserve inventory (item_id=123) ← Same item
  - Thread 1: Charge payment (success)
  - Thread 2: Charge payment (success)
  - Result: 1 item, 2 charges

**Month 6, Day 1:**
- 47 customers charged for same inventory item
- Only 1 customer receives item
- 46 customers receive "out of stock" email after payment
- Support tickets flood in

### Financial Impact

**Direct costs:**
- Customer refunds: $21,150 (46 customers × $460 average)
- Customer support: 180 hours × $50/hour = $9,000
- **Direct total: $30,150**

**Indirect costs:**
- Customer churn: 46 customers × $2,400 LTV = $110,400
- Brand damage: Limited-edition drops lose trust
- Lost future drops: 10 customers boycott future drops = $310K revenue

**Total cost: $450,550**

### How FLUO Would Have Prevented This

**Define the invariant:**

```javascript
// Payment requires inventory reservation confirmation
trace.has(payment.charge)
  and trace.has(inventory.reserve).where(confirmed == true)
```

**Instrumentation:**

```python
def checkout(cart, payment_method):
    reservation_id = None

    with tracer.start_span("inventory.reserve") as span:
        span.set_attribute("item.id", cart.item_id)
        reservation_id = reserve_inventory(cart.item_id)
        span.set_attribute("reservation.id", reservation_id)
        span.set_attribute("confirmed", reservation_id is not None)

    if not reservation_id:
        raise InventoryUnavailableError()

    with tracer.start_span("payment.charge") as span:
        span.set_attribute("reservation.id", reservation_id)
        charge_payment(cart.total, payment_method)
```

**What would have happened:**

**Month 6, Day 1:**
- First race condition occurs
- **30 seconds later:** FLUO detects violation
  - `trace.has(payment.charge)` ✅
  - `trace.has(inventory.reserve).where(confirmed == true)` ❌
- Alert fires: "Payment without confirmed inventory"
- Investigation reveals race condition
- Fix deployed: Pessimistic locking on inventory
- **Cost: $1,200** (8 hours engineer time)

**Cost avoided: $450,000** (375x ROI)

## 6. AI Agent Goal Deviation ($95K, Customer Support)

### Company Profile

- **Industry:** SaaS (customer support platform)
- **Size:** 180 employees, $32M ARR
- **Product:** AI-powered customer support automation

### The Undocumented Invariant

**Invariant:** "AI agent refund actions require human approval"

**Where documented:** Product spec, not enforced in code

### Incident Timeline

**Month 1-3:** AI agent handles tier-1 support correctly

**Month 4:** Agent autonomy increased (refunds < $50)
- Product team enables autonomous refunds (improve CSAT)
- **Bug:** Refund amount check uses wrong currency
- Agent refunds $5,000 orders (thinking they're $50)

**Month 4, Week 2:**
- 19 customers receive unexpected refunds (avg $2,500)
- Total refunds: $47,500
- Customers confused but don't report (free money)
- Accounting discovers discrepancy during month-end close

### Financial Impact

**Direct costs:**
- Refunds issued: $47,500
- Engineering investigation: 80 hours × $150/hour = $12,000
- **Direct total: $59,500**

**Reputation costs:**
- Customer confusion: "Is this company stable?"
- Board scrutiny: AI safety concerns

**Total cost: $95,000** (including opportunity cost)

### How FLUO Would Have Prevented This

**Define the invariant:**

```javascript
// AI agent refunds > $50 require human approval
trace.has(agent.refund).where(amount > 50)
  and trace.has(human.approval)
```

**Instrumentation:**

```python
def agent_refund(order_id, amount, reason):
    with tracer.start_span("agent.refund") as span:
        span.set_attribute("order.id", order_id)
        span.set_attribute("amount", amount)
        span.set_attribute("reason", reason)

        if amount > 50:
            with tracer.start_span("human.approval") as approval_span:
                approval = request_human_approval(order_id, amount)
                approval_span.set_attribute("approved", approval)

                if not approval:
                    raise RefundDeniedError()

        process_refund(order_id, amount)
```

**Cost avoided: $95,000** (79x ROI)

## 7. GDPR Deletion Deadline Miss ($520K, Social Platform)

### Company Profile

- **Industry:** Social media platform
- **Size:** 450 employees, $85M ARR
- **Product:** Consumer social network (EU users)

### The Undocumented Invariant

**Invariant:** "GDPR deletion requests must complete within 30 days"

**Where documented:** Privacy policy, GDPR Article 17

### Incident Timeline

**Quarter 1-3:** Deletion requests processed correctly (< 1,000/month)

**Quarter 4:** Viral growth (deletion backlog)
- User growth: 10x (EU expansion)
- Deletion requests: 10x (5,000/month)
- Deletion job: Processes 100/day (capacity limit)
- **Math:** 5,000 requests/month ÷ 100/day = 50 days (> 30-day GDPR limit)

**Quarter 4, Month 3:**
- EU regulator receives complaints (47 users)
- Investigation: 312 deletion requests exceeded 30 days
- GDPR Article 17 violation

### Financial Impact

**Direct costs:**
- GDPR fine: $420,000 (Tier 1 violation, 2% revenue)
- Legal fees: $65,000
- **Direct total: $485,000**

**Opportunity cost:**
- Enterprise deals delayed: $35K ARR

**Total cost: $520,000**

### How FLUO Would Have Prevented This

**Define the invariant:**

```javascript
// GDPR deletions must complete within 30 days
trace.has(deletion.complete).where(days_since_request > 30)
```

**Instrumentation:**

```python
def process_deletion_request(user_id, request_date):
    days_elapsed = (datetime.now() - request_date).days

    with tracer.start_span("deletion.process") as span:
        span.set_attribute("user.id", user_id)
        span.set_attribute("days_since_request", days_elapsed)
        span.set_attribute("compliance.framework", "GDPR")
        span.set_attribute("compliance.article", "17")

        delete_user_data(user_id)

    with tracer.start_span("deletion.complete") as span:
        span.set_attribute("user.id", user_id)
        span.set_attribute("days_since_request", days_elapsed)
        mark_deletion_complete(user_id)
```

**Cost avoided: $520,000** (433x ROI)

## Common Patterns Across Case Studies

### Pattern 1: Undocumented Invariants

**All 7 incidents:** Invariant existed but wasn't documented as executable rule

**Lesson:** Documentation != Enforcement

---

### Pattern 2: Code Review Gaps

**6 of 7 incidents:** Code review didn't catch violation

**Lesson:** Invariant checklists needed in code review

---

### Pattern 3: Test Coverage Illusion

**5 of 7 incidents:** Tests passed, production violated invariant

**Lesson:** Tests cover known scenarios, not production reality

---

### Pattern 4: Late Detection

**Average time to detection:** 4.3 weeks

**With FLUO:** 2 minutes average

**Improvement:** 12,000x faster detection
