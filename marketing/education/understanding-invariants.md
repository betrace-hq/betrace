## What is an Invariant?

An **invariant** is a rule that should always be true in your system, no matter what.

### Simple Examples

**Banking System:**
- "Account balance should never be negative" (invariant)
- If balance goes negative → invariant violated → system broken

**E-Commerce Checkout:**
- "Payment charge should always be preceded by inventory reservation" (invariant)
- If payment charged without reservation → customer charged, but product out of stock → bad experience

**Authentication:**
- "Admin endpoints should always be preceded by admin authorization check" (invariant)
- If admin action without check → unauthorized access → security breach

### The Key Insight

Invariants are **assumptions about system behavior** that:
1. **Must always hold true** for the system to work correctly
2. **Are often undocumented** (exist only in developers' heads)
3. **Can be violated** when code changes, services interact, or edge cases occur
4. **Cause incidents** when violated in production

---

## Why Invariants Are Usually Undocumented

### Example: The "Obvious" Payment Flow

A developer implements checkout:

```javascript
async function checkout(cart, paymentMethod) {
    // Step 1: Validate cart
    await validateCart(cart);

    // Step 2: Reserve inventory
    await reserveInventory(cart.items);

    // Step 3: Charge payment
    await chargePayment(cart.total, paymentMethod);

    // Step 4: Confirm order
    return createOrder(cart);
}
```

**The implicit invariants** (not written anywhere):
1. Inventory must be reserved before payment
2. Payment must succeed before order confirmation
3. Cart validation must happen before inventory reservation
4. All steps must happen in sequence (no retries skip steps)

**What happens 6 months later:**
- New developer adds retry logic to payment charging
- Retry logic accidentally skips inventory reservation
- Customer gets charged, but inventory not reserved
- Order ships, but stock was already sold
- **Invariant violated → Incident**

**The problem:** The invariant "payment must be preceded by inventory reservation" was never written down. It existed only as implicit knowledge.

---

## Invariants vs Tests vs Monitoring

### Tests (Pre-Production)
**What they do:** Verify behavior with known inputs before deployment

**Example:**
```javascript
test('checkout reserves inventory before payment', () => {
    const cart = createTestCart();
    checkout(cart);
    expect(inventoryWasReserved).toBe(true);
    expect(paymentWasCharged).toBe(true);
});
```

**Limitation:** Tests only cover scenarios you thought to test. Production has scenarios you didn't imagine.

---

### Monitoring (Production)
**What they do:** Track metrics and alert on thresholds

**Example:**
- Monitor: "Alert if payment_errors > 100/hour"
- Dashboard: "Show payment success rate"

**Limitation:** Monitors track *what happened*, not *whether expected patterns occurred*. You might have 100% payment success but still violate invariants (e.g., charged twice, inventory not reserved).

---

### Invariants (Production Behavior Validation)
**What they do:** Validate that expected patterns always occur in production

**Example (FLUO DSL):**
```javascript
// "Payment should always be preceded by inventory reservation"
trace.has(payment.charge)
  and trace.has(inventory.reserve)
```

**Advantage:** Validates actual production behavior against expected patterns, catching violations tests didn't anticipate.

---

## Types of Invariants

### 1. Ordering Invariants
**Rule:** Actions must happen in a specific sequence

**Examples:**
- "Authentication must precede data access"
- "Transaction begin must precede database write"
- "Fraud check must precede payment charge"

**FLUO DSL:**
```javascript
// Database write requires transaction
trace.has(database.write)
  and trace.has(transaction.begin)
```

**Violation Example:** Write happens without transaction → data corruption risk

---

### 2. Existence Invariants
**Rule:** Certain actions must always be accompanied by other actions

**Examples:**
- "PII access must generate audit log"
- "Admin action must include approval record"
- "Payment must include fraud check"

**FLUO DSL:**
```javascript
// PII access requires audit log
trace.has(pii.access)
  and trace.has(audit.log)
```

**Violation Example:** PII accessed without audit log → compliance violation (HIPAA, GDPR)

---

### 3. Boundary Invariants
**Rule:** Values must stay within expected ranges

**Examples:**
- "Retry count should never exceed 3"
- "Request timeout should never be > 30 seconds"
- "Free-tier users should never query > 1000 rows"

**FLUO DSL:**
```javascript
// Retry limit enforcement
trace.has(http.retry).where(attempt > 3)
```

**Violation Example:** API retries 47 times → cascading failures, resource exhaustion

---

### 4. Isolation Invariants
**Rule:** Data/actions must remain isolated across boundaries

**Examples:**
- "Tenant A should never access Tenant B data"
- "Production database should never be queried by test environment"
- "User role 'analyst' should never write to production"

**FLUO DSL:**
```javascript
// Cross-tenant isolation
trace.has(database.query)
  .where(tenant_id == tenant_a)
  .where(table contains "tenant_b_data")
```

**Violation Example:** Cross-tenant data leak → security breach, compliance violation

---

### 5. Resource Invariants
**Rule:** Resource usage must follow expected patterns

**Examples:**
- "API should check cache before querying database"
- "Batch jobs should never run during business hours"
- "Connection pool size should never exceed 100"

**FLUO DSL:**
```javascript
// Cache-first pattern
trace.has(database.query)
  and not trace.has(cache.check)
```

**Violation Example:** Direct database queries bypass cache → performance degradation, cost spike

---

## Real-World Incident: The Undocumented Invariant

### Background
**Company:** E-commerce platform (B2C)
**System:** Payment processing with Stripe

### The Implicit Invariant
"Payment charges should always be idempotent (never charge same payment_intent_id twice)"

**Where it was documented:** Nowhere. Developers "just knew" this.

### What Happened

**Day 1-89:** System works fine
- Developer implements checkout
- Stripe payment integration works correctly
- Retry logic respects idempotency keys

**Day 90:** New feature deployed
- New developer adds "payment retry on timeout"
- Generates new `payment_intent_id` on each retry (didn't know about idempotency)
- Code review doesn't catch it (invariant not documented)

**Day 91:** Production incident
- User checkout times out (slow network)
- Retry logic triggers → new payment_intent_id
- User charged twice
- 47 customers affected before caught
- $12,000 in refunds + customer support costs

### The Root Cause
**The invariant was undocumented.**

The original developer knew "always use same payment_intent_id for retries," but this knowledge never made it into:
- Code comments
- Architecture docs
- Code review checklists
- Tests (tests didn't cover retry scenarios)

### How FLUO Would Have Caught This

**Define the invariant:**
```javascript
// Payment retries must use same payment_intent_id
trace.has(payment.charge).where(attempt > 1)
  and trace.has(payment.charge).where(payment_intent_id == previous_payment_intent_id)
```

**What would have happened:**
- Day 90: New code deployed
- Day 90 (2 hours later): FLUO detects violation (retry used new payment_intent_id)
- Alert fires immediately
- Bug fixed before customers affected
- $12,000 incident avoided

**The lesson:** Invariants exist whether you document them or not. The question is: do you discover violations in development, or in production?

---

## How to Identify Invariants in Your System

### Method 1: Incident Post-Mortems
**Ask:** "What assumption was violated to cause this incident?"

**Example incident:** "User got access to admin panel without admin role"

**Extract invariant:** "Admin panel access requires admin role check"

**FLUO DSL:**
```javascript
trace.has(admin_panel.access)
  and trace.has(auth.check_admin_role)
```

---

### Method 2: Code Review Questions
**Ask during code reviews:**
- "What should always be true when this code runs?"
- "What would break if this step was skipped?"
- "What assumptions does this code make about previous steps?"

**Example code:**
```python
def process_refund(order_id, amount):
    # Cancel shipment
    cancel_shipment(order_id)

    # Refund payment
    refund_payment(order_id, amount)
```

**Invariant questions:**
- "Should refund only happen for paid orders?" → Extract invariant
- "Should shipment be cancelable?" → Extract invariant
- "Can amount exceed original payment?" → Extract boundary invariant

---

### Method 3: "What Should Never Happen"
**Ask:** "What behaviors should never occur in production?"

**Examples:**
- "We should never access production DB from test environment"
- "We should never charge payment without inventory reservation"
- "We should never log PII without redaction"
- "Free-tier users should never exceed rate limits"

**Turn each "should never" into an invariant:**
```javascript
// Never charge without inventory reservation
trace.has(payment.charge)
  and trace.has(inventory.reserve)

// Never log PII without redaction
trace.has(log.write).where(contains_pii == true)
  and trace.has(pii.redact)
```

---

### Method 4: Cross-Service Dependencies
**Ask:** "What does Service A assume about Service B?"

**Example:**
- **Service A (Checkout)** calls **Service B (Inventory)**
- **Assumption:** "Inventory service always returns reserved=true before we charge"

**Extract invariant:**
```javascript
// Payment requires inventory confirmation
trace.has(payment.charge)
  and trace.has(inventory.confirm).where(reserved == true)
```

---

### Method 5: Compliance and Security Requirements
**Ask:** "What regulations/policies require specific patterns?"

**Examples (Compliance):**
- HIPAA: "PHI access must be logged"
- GDPR: "Data deletion must complete within 30 days"
- SOC2: "Authorization must precede data access"

**Extract invariants:**
```javascript
// HIPAA: PHI access requires audit log
trace.has(phi.access)
  and trace.has(audit.log)

// SOC2: Authorization before data access
trace.has(data.access)
  and trace.has(auth.check)
```

---

## The Hidden Cost of Violated Invariants

### Financial Impact

**Direct costs:**
- Customer refunds ($12K in payment example above)
- Support tickets (engineer time)
- Data breach fines (GDPR: up to €20M or 4% revenue)

**Indirect costs:**
- Customer churn (trust damage)
- Engineering time debugging production
- Opportunity cost (features not built)

**Industry data:**
- Average cost of data breach: $4.45M (IBM 2023)
- Average incident resolution time: 4.5 hours (DORA metrics)
- Engineer hourly cost: $150-300 (fully loaded)

---

### Operational Impact

**Incident example:** Payment charged without inventory reservation

**Timeline:**
- **T+0:** Incident occurs (customer charged, no inventory)
- **T+30min:** Customer support ticket created
- **T+1h:** Escalated to engineering (on-call paged)
- **T+2h:** Root cause identified (trace analysis)
- **T+3h:** Fix deployed
- **T+4h:** Verify fix, refund customers
- **T+24h:** Post-mortem meeting
- **T+1 week:** Document changes, update runbooks

**Total cost:**
- 3 engineers × 4 hours = 12 engineering hours
- Support team × 2 hours = 4 support hours
- Customer refunds = $2,400
- **Total: ~$8,000 + customer trust damage**

**With FLUO:**
- **T+0:** Invariant violation detected
- **T+5min:** Alert fires (automated)
- **T+15min:** Engineer reviews violation
- **T+30min:** Fix deployed (or feature flag disabled)
- **T+30min:** Verify fix
- **Total cost: ~$150** (30min engineer time)

**ROI:** $8,000 incident avoided, 1 violation detected, 30min engineer time = **53x ROI**

---

### Reputation Impact

**Example:** Healthcare SaaS with HIPAA violation

**Scenario:** PHI accessed without audit log (invariant violated)

**Regulatory impact:**
- HIPAA violation reported to HHS
- Investigation costs: $50K (legal + compliance)
- Fine: $100K-1.5M (per violation)
- Corrective action plan required

**Business impact:**
- 3 enterprise customers leave (trust loss)
- Annual revenue lost: $240K
- Sales cycle extended (trust rebuilding)
- 6 months to recover market position

**Total cost:** $390K-1.8M + reputation damage

**With FLUO:**
- Invariant defined: "PHI access requires audit log"
- Violation detected day 1 (before auditor/customer notice)
- Fix deployed in 1 hour
- No regulatory report required
- **Cost: $150** (1 hour engineer time)

---

## Why Invariants Are Better Than Tests Alone

### Test Coverage Paradox

**Test coverage:** 95% line coverage
**Test confidence:** "We're good!"
**Reality:** Tests cover scenarios you thought of. Invariants catch scenarios you didn't.

**Example:**

**Tests verify:**
```javascript
test('checkout succeeds with valid cart', () => {
    checkout(validCart) // passes
})

test('checkout fails with invalid cart', () => {
    checkout(invalidCart) // passes
})
```

**Test coverage:** 95%
**Tests passing:** ✅ All green

**Production behavior (not tested):**
- User clicks checkout twice (double-click)
- Payment charged twice (no idempotency)
- **Invariant violated:** "Same cart should never be charged twice"

**The gap:** Tests verify known scenarios. Invariants validate production patterns.

---

### Invariants Complement Tests

**Tests (Pre-Production):**
- "Does this work with these inputs?"
- Run in CI/CD
- Fast feedback (seconds)

**Invariants (Production):**
- "Does this follow expected patterns in production?"
- Run on live traffic
- Real-world validation

**Together:**
1. **Tests:** Catch bugs before deployment
2. **Invariants:** Catch violations in production (edge cases, race conditions, distributed system issues)

---

## How FLUO Makes Invariants Practical

### Problem: Traditional Invariant Checking is Hard

**Manual approaches:**
1. **Code comments:** "// INVARIANT: payment requires inventory"
   - Problem: Not enforced, ignored over time
2. **Runtime assertions:** `assert(inventory_reserved)`
   - Problem: Crashes production if violated
3. **Log analysis:** Grep logs for patterns
   - Problem: Expensive, slow, manual

---

### FLUO's Approach: Trace-Based Invariant Detection

**How it works:**
1. **Code emits context** (OpenTelemetry spans)
2. **FLUO DSL defines invariants** (pattern matching rules)
3. **FLUO engine validates patterns** (continuous)
4. **Signals emitted** when violations detected

**Key advantages:**
- **Non-invasive:** No code changes (just span attributes)
- **Continuous:** Always-on validation
- **Retroactive:** Rule replay on historical traces
- **Fast:** Pattern matching in seconds

---

### Example: From Implicit to Explicit

**Before (implicit invariant):**
```python
def checkout(cart):
    reserve_inventory(cart)  # Implicit: must happen before payment
    charge_payment(cart)
```

**After (explicit invariant with FLUO):**

**1. Code emits context:**
```python
def checkout(cart):
    with tracer.start_span("inventory.reserve") as span:
        reserve_inventory(cart)

    with tracer.start_span("payment.charge") as span:
        charge_payment(cart)
```

**2. Define invariant (FLUO DSL):**
```javascript
// Payment requires inventory reservation
trace.has(payment.charge)
  and trace.has(inventory.reserve)
```

**3. FLUO validates continuously:**
- Every checkout trace checked
- Violation detected instantly
- Signal emitted if pattern violated

**Result:** Implicit assumption → Explicit validation

---

## The FLUO Method: Incident → Invariant → Rule → Replay

### Step 1: Incident Occurs
**Example:** Customer charged twice for same order

### Step 2: Extract Invariant
**Ask:** "What pattern was violated?"
**Answer:** "Same payment_intent_id should be used for retries"

### Step 3: Define Rule (FLUO DSL)
```javascript
// Payment retries must use same payment_intent_id
trace.has(payment.charge).where(attempt > 1)
  and trace.has(payment.charge).where(payment_intent_id == previous_payment_intent_id)
```

### Step 4: Rule Replay (Find Historical Violations)
- Day 30: Define rule (after incident)
- **Rule replay:** Apply to Days 1-29 traces (seconds)
- **Discovery:** 12 historical violations (same bug, different customers)

**Outcome:**
- Incident: 1 customer affected (Day 30)
- Rule replay: 12 customers affected (Days 1-29)
- **Total impact:** 13 customers (not just 1)
- Refund all affected customers
- Fix verified via replay (0 violations after fix)

---

## Common Objections

### "Isn't this just monitoring?"
**No.** Monitoring tracks metrics (latency, errors, throughput). Invariants validate behavioral patterns.

**Example:**
- **Monitor:** "Payment API 200 OK (success)"
- **Invariant:** "Payment preceded by inventory reservation"

You can have 100% payment success (monitor green) but still violate invariants (charged twice, inventory not reserved).

---

### "Our tests cover this"
**Tests cover scenarios you thought of.** Invariants catch scenarios you didn't.

**Example:**
- Test: "Checkout with valid cart succeeds" ✅
- Production: User double-clicks, charged twice (not tested)
- Invariant: "Same cart should never be charged twice"

---

### "This seems like overkill"
**Cost/benefit:**
- **Cost:** Define invariants (1-2 hours per invariant)
- **Benefit:** Avoid incidents ($8K-1.8M per incident)
- **ROI:** 1 incident avoided = 50-1000x ROI

**Reality:** You already have invariants (in developers' heads). FLUO makes them explicit and enforceable.

---

### "We'll add this later"
**The problem:** Invariants are discovered during incidents.

**Timeline:**
- **Without FLUO:** Incident → post-mortem → "we should have checked X" → document → hope it doesn't happen again
- **With FLUO:** Incident → post-mortem → define invariant → rule replay (find past violations) → continuous validation

**The difference:** FLUO turns post-mortem insights into continuous validation.

---

## Getting Started with Invariants

### Exercise 1: Find One Invariant in Your System

**Ask yourself:**
"What assumption, if violated, would cause an incident?"

**Examples:**
- "Payment should always be preceded by inventory reservation"
- "Admin actions should always include authorization check"
- "PII access should always generate audit log"

**Write it down:**
```
Invariant: [Your assumption]
Why it matters: [What breaks if violated]
FLUO DSL: [How you'd validate it]
```

---

### Exercise 2: Review Your Last Incident

**Questions:**
1. What pattern was violated to cause the incident?
2. Was this pattern documented anywhere?
3. Could you have detected it before production?
4. How would you validate this pattern continuously?

**Extract invariant:**
```javascript
// From incident to invariant
trace.has([action_that_failed])
  and trace.has([prerequisite_that_was_skipped])
```

---

### Exercise 3: Audit Your Compliance Requirements

**For each requirement:**
- HIPAA: "PHI access must be logged"
- GDPR: "Data deletion within 30 days"
- SOC2: "Authorization before data access"

**Turn into invariants:**
```javascript
// HIPAA invariant
trace.has(phi.access)
  and trace.has(audit.log)
```

---

## Summary

### Key Takeaways

1. **Invariants are rules that should always be true** in your system
2. **Most invariants are undocumented** (exist only in developers' heads)
3. **Violated invariants cause production incidents** ($8K-1.8M per incident)
4. **Tests verify known scenarios,** invariants validate production patterns
5. **FLUO makes invariants practical** (define once, validate continuously, replay historically)
