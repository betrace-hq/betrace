## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Identify One Critical Invariant (15 minutes)

**Method 1: From last incident**
- Review your last production incident
- Ask: "What pattern was violated?"
- Extract invariant from root cause

**Method 2: From compliance requirement**
- Pick one compliance control (HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR)
- Ask: "How do we prove this works in production?"
- Define invariant

**Method 3: From domain playbook**
- Choose relevant playbook (SRE, Security, E-Commerce, etc.)
- Pick one critical invariant template
- Customize for your system

---

### Step 2: Define BeTrace Rule (30 minutes)

**Template:**
```yaml
rules:
  - id: your-invariant-id
    name: "Human-readable name"
    description: "What this invariant validates"
    severity: critical
    condition: |
      trace.has(operation)
        and trace.has(prerequisite)
```

**Resources:**
- [BeTrace DSL Reference](../../docs/technical/trace-rules-dsl.md)
- [Invariant Template Library](./templates/invariant-library.md)

---

### Step 3: Instrument Code (1-2 hours)

**Add OpenTelemetry spans:**

```python
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

def your_operation():
    with tracer.start_span("operation.name") as span:
        span.set_attribute("key", value)
        perform_operation()
```

**Resources:**
- [OpenTelemetry Documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/)
- [Instrumentation examples in playbooks](./playbooks/README.md)

---

### Step 4: Deploy and Validate (30 minutes)

1. Deploy instrumentation to staging
2. Verify spans appear in traces
3. Deploy BeTrace rule
4. Test violation detection (intentionally violate invariant)
5. Deploy to production
6. Monitor alerts

---

### Step 5: Expand Coverage (ongoing)

**Month 1:** 5 critical invariants
**Month 3:** 20 invariants
**Month 6:** 50+ invariants

**Prioritization:**
1. P0: Security, compliance, financial
2. P1: Customer experience, data integrity
3. P2: Performance, reliability

## FAQ

### What's the difference between invariants and tests?

**Tests:** Verify behavior with known inputs (pre-deployment)
**Invariants:** Validate patterns in production (real traffic)

**Together:** Tests catch bugs before deployment, invariants catch violations in production.

---

### Do I need to replace my existing tests?

No. IDD complements TDD, doesn't replace it.

**Keep TDD for:** Unit logic, edge cases, API contracts
**Add IDD for:** Production patterns, cross-service invariants, compliance requirements

---

### How long does it take to define an invariant?

**First invariant:** 2-3 hours (learning curve)
**Subsequent invariants:** 30-60 minutes

**Breakdown:**
- Define invariant: 15-30 min
- Add instrumentation: 1-2 hours (one-time per service)
- Deploy BeTrace rule: 15 min

---

### What's the typical ROI?

**Investment:** $200-$600 per invariant
**Return:** $50K-$500K per incident avoided

**Typical ROI:** 10-100x (first year)

**Factors:**
- Industry (healthcare/finance = higher ROI)
- Company size (larger = more impact)
- Incident history (more incidents = higher ROI)

---

### Can BeTrace replace monitoring?

No. BeTrace complements monitoring.

**Monitoring:** Tracks metrics (latency, errors, throughput)
**BeTrace:** Validates behavioral patterns (invariants)

**Together:** Monitoring shows "what happened", BeTrace validates "did expected patterns occur"

---

### Do I need OpenTelemetry?

Yes. BeTrace validates patterns in OpenTelemetry traces.

**Good news:** Many frameworks have auto-instrumentation
**Investment:** 1-2 hours per service (one-time)

---

### How do I prioritize which invariants to define?

**Priority framework:**
1. **P0:** Security, compliance, financial (define first)
2. **P1:** Customer experience, data integrity
3. **P2:** Performance, reliability

**Start with:** Top 5 P0 invariants (from incidents or compliance)

---

### Can I use BeTrace with my existing observability stack?

Yes. BeTrace works with any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend.

**Compatible with:**
- Grafana Tempo
- Jaeger
- Zipkin
- AWS X-Ray
- Google Cloud Trace
- Datadog APM
