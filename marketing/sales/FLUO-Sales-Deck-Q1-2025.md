# BeTrace Sales Deck - Q1 2025

**Note**: This is the content outline for a PowerPoint/Keynote deck. Design team should create visual slides with BeTrace branding.

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Visual**: BeTrace logo, clean background

**Text**:
```
BeTrace
Behavioral Assurance for AI Systems

Validated by 96 AI Safety Experts from 30+ Countries
```

**Presenter Notes**: Open with confidence. The International AI Safety Report validates our entire market category.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem (Part 1) - The Quote

**Visual**: Large quote on screen, impactful typography

**Text**:
```
"Hardware-enabled mechanisms could help customers
and regulators to monitor general-purpose AI systems
more effectively during deployment...but reliable
mechanisms of this kind do not yet exist."

â€” International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI
   96 experts, 30+ countries, Chair: Yoshua Bengio
   January 2025
```

**Presenter Notes**: Let this sink in. 96 experts concluded the monitoring mechanisms enterprises need DON'T EXIST YET. We built them.

---

## Slide 3: The Problem (Part 2) - The Evidence

**Visual**: Three columns with icons

**Text**:
```
THREE CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED BY THE REPORT

ðŸ”¬ Pre-Deployment Testing Fails
"Spot checks miss hazards because
test conditions differ from real world"

â†’ Can't predict production behavior
â†’ Edge cases emerge only in production
â†’ Passing tests â‰  safe

ðŸ”’ AI Internals Are Inscrutable
"Developers cannot explain why
models create outputs"

â†’ Can't debug AI failures
â†’ Interpretability research "nascent"
â†’ Black box problem

ðŸ“Š No Quantitative Risk Metrics
"Lack quantitative risk estimation
unlike aerospace/nuclear"

â†’ Can't measure safety improvements
â†’ No "1 in 1 million" guarantees
â†’ Flying blind
```

**Presenter Notes**: Walk through each gap. Ask: "Does your organization face these challenges?" (They do.)

---

## Slide 4: The AI Agent Problem

**Visual**: Timeline showing rapid advancement

**Text**:
```
AI AGENTS: WHY THIS MATTERS NOW

"Testing is insufficient for agents because they can
distinguish testing conditions from real-world conditions"

SWE-Bench Coding Benchmark Progress:
Oct 2023:  2% â–“â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘
May 2024:  26% â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘
Dec 2024:  42% â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–“â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘

â†’ Capabilities advancing RAPIDLY
â†’ Testing CANNOT assure agent safety
â†’ Every major AI company investing heavily

Problem: Agents can "game" tests, then behave differently in production
```

**Presenter Notes**: This is urgent. Companies deploying agents RIGHT NOW with no way to monitor them.

---

## Slide 5: BeTrace's Solution - Overview

**Visual**: Clean diagram showing the workflow

**Text**:
```
BEHAVIORAL ASSURANCE FOR AI SYSTEMS

OpenTelemetry Traces â†’ Pattern Matching â†’ Signals â†’ Investigation

NOT pre-deployment testing (we monitor production)
NOT interpretability (we observe behavior, not internals)
NOT traditional monitoring (we detect patterns, not just metrics)

IS: Continuous behavioral verification in production
```

**Presenter Notes**: We're not competitive with existing approaches â€” we're complementary. We catch what testing misses.

---

## Slide 6: How It Works (Visual)

**Visual**: Animated flow diagram

**Text**:
```
1. INSTRUMENT                    2. DEFINE PATTERNS              3. MONITOR
   Your AI systems                  Expected behaviors               Real-time detection
   â†“                                â†“                                â†“
   @WithSpan("ai.inference")        Medical diagnosis requires       Violations trigger alerts
   Add OpenTelemetry                source citations                Compliance spans generated
   to all AI calls                                                   Dashboard updated

   Implementation: 1-2 weeks        Implementation: 1-2 weeks        Result: Continuous safety
```

**Presenter Notes**: Three steps to production. 5 weeks total from start to full monitoring.

---

## Slide 7: Use Case 1 - AI Agent Monitoring

**Visual**: Split screen - Before/Without BeTrace vs. After/With BeTrace

**Text**:
```
USE CASE: Legal Research Agent

THE RISK:
â€¢ Agent accesses privileged documents without authorization
â€¢ Agent deviates from research scope (privacy violation)
â€¢ Agent delegates to unapproved third-party AI services

WHY TESTING FAILS:
"Agents can distinguish test from production" â€” Report Section 3.2.1

BeTrace DETECTION:
âœ… Real-time: "Agent accessed unauthorized database: internal-hr-docs"
âœ… Real-time: "Agent goal deviated from original query (score: 0.42)"
âœ… Evidence: Compliance span generated for audit trail

BUSINESS IMPACT:
â€¢ Prevents malpractice liability ($2.5M claim avoided)
â€¢ Maintains attorney-client privilege
â€¢ 99.7% of agent operations within authorized boundaries
```

**Presenter Notes**: Show code example if technical audience. Focus on business impact otherwise.

---

## Slide 8: Use Case 2 - Healthcare Hallucination Detection

**Visual**: Healthcare icons, clean medical imagery

**Text**:
```
USE CASE: Clinical Decision Support

THE RISK:
â€¢ AI provides medical diagnosis without evidence
â€¢ Low-confidence recommendations stated as fact
â€¢ Patient harm â†’ malpractice lawsuit

WHY TESTING FAILS:
Can't test all medical scenarios, hallucinations context-dependent

BeTrace DETECTION:
âœ… Pattern: "Medical diagnosis requires citations"
âœ… Violation: "Diagnosis without citation (clinical-ai-02, Patient P-4829)"
âœ… Action: Diagnosis withheld from EHR, escalated to physician

BUSINESS IMPACT:
â€¢ $5M malpractice claim avoided
â€¢ 99.8% of diagnoses include citations
â€¢ Automatic HIPAA audit trail
â€¢ ROI: 167x in first 90 days
```

**Presenter Notes**: Healthcare is high-stakes. Emphasize liability prevention and compliance.

---

## Slide 9: Use Case 3 - Financial Services Bias Detection

**Visual**: Bar charts showing approval rate distributions

**Text**:
```
USE CASE: Loan Approval AI

THE RISK:
â€¢ AI exhibits demographic bias (not visible in testing)
â€¢ Regulatory violations (ECOA, GDPR Article 22)
â€¢ Massive fines ($10-50M)

WHY TESTING FAILS:
Subtle bias emerges across thousands of decisions, not visible in small test sets

BeTrace DETECTION:
âœ… Pattern: Statistical distribution analysis by demographics
âœ… Alert: "Approval rate variance by gender exceeds threshold"
âœ… Dashboard: Real-time bias metrics (30-day rolling window)

BUSINESS IMPACT:
â€¢ $15M regulatory fine avoided
â€¢ Continuous compliance (vs. quarterly manual audits)
â€¢ ROI: 262x in first 90 days
```

**Presenter Notes**: Financial services = regulatory risk. Emphasize fine prevention and continuous compliance.

## Slide 10: Report Validation - Gaps â†’ BeTrace Solutions

**Visual**: Table/matrix showing mapping

**Text**:
```
EVERY CHALLENGE IDENTIFIED â†’ BeTrace PROVIDES SOLUTION

Report Finding                          BeTrace Solution
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
"Pre-deployment testing fails"      â†’   Production trace monitoring
"Test conditions â‰  real world"      â†’   Observes actual production behavior
"AI internals inscrutable"          â†’   Observe behavior externally
"No quantitative risk metrics"      â†’   Pattern match rates, violation counts
"Monitoring mechanisms don't exist" â†’   BeTrace exists (OpenTelemetry-based)
"Agent testing insufficient"        â†’   Runtime agent behavioral monitoring
"Spot checks miss hazards"          â†’   Continuous evaluation, not one-time
```

**Presenter Notes**: Every gap the report identified, we fill. This isn't opinion â€” it's validation from 96 experts.

Interpretability      | Ongoing       | "Severely limited"    | âœ… Observe behavior
research              | research      | (per report)          |    instead

Traditional           | Production    | Not behavioral        | âœ… Pattern-based
monitoring            |               |                       |    assurance
```

**Presenter Notes**: We don't replace testing or training. We catch what they miss. Complementary value prop.

## Presenter Notes - General Tips

**Opening (First 3 slides)**:
- Start with the quote (Slide 2) - let it land
- Ask: "Have you read the International AI Safety Report?" (Most haven't)
- Establish credibility: 96 experts, 30+ countries
- Pause after Slide 3: "Do these challenges sound familiar?"

**Middle (Slides 4-11)**:
- Tailor use cases to audience (healthcare â†’ healthcare example)
- Show code only to technical audiences
- Focus on business impact (ROI, liability prevention)
- Use report validation repeatedly ("The report says...")

**Close (Slides 12-19)**:
- ROI is the hammer (35-437x, payback < 2 months)
- Implementation is fast (5 weeks)
- Give multiple next-step options
- Ask for the pilot TODAY if buyer signals strong interest

**Objection Handling**:
- "We already have monitoring" â†’ "Traditional monitoring â‰  behavioral assurance" (Slide 11)
- "Too expensive" â†’ "One incident costs $3-50M, BeTrace costs $87K/year" (Slide 12)
- "We'll wait" â†’ "Report says risks emerge in leaps. By the time there's an incident, it's too late" (Slide 4)
- "Not sure we need it" â†’ "96 experts from 30 countries concluded monitoring mechanisms don't exist yet. You need them" (Slide 2)

**Discovery Questions to Ask**:
1. "What AI systems are you currently deploying or planning to deploy?"
2. "Have you had any AI-related incidents or near-misses?"
3. "How do you currently validate AI behavior in production vs. testing?"
4. "If regulators asked for evidence of AI safety, what could you provide?"
5. "How would you know if your AI agent was operating outside expected parameters?"

**Qualification Criteria (BANT)**:
- **Budget**: Do they have budget for AI safety? (If deploying AI, answer is yes)
- **Authority**: Are you speaking to decision-maker? (If not, get intro)
- **Need**: Do they face AI safety challenges? (If deploying AI, answer is yes)
- **Timeline**: When are they deploying AI / when did incidents occur? (Urgency)

**Next Steps After Demo**:
- Send: Whitepaper, case studies, pilot proposal
- Schedule: Follow-up technical deep-dive or exec briefing
- Ask: "What would need to be true for you to start a pilot in the next 30 days?"
